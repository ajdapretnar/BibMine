    "## Visualization of Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using pyLDAvis visualization by [Ben Mabey](https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis) who adapted the original R package to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "pyLDAvis shows topics as circles in a 2D plot. This is an approximation of topic similarity. The more similar two topics are, the closer they will be in the plot. The size of the circle corresponds to the presence of the topic in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization shows the top 30 most salient terms (not frequent!), where saliency refers to the importance of each word for the topic. If a word is frequent in a topic, but also in the entire corpus, it will get a lower saliency score than a word that is frequent in a topic alone. Conceptually, it is similar to TF-IDF.\n",
    "If the topic is selected, it shows most relevant (frequent) terms in a selected topic. Relevance is similar to saliency. It is a weighted measure of term probability and lift, where lambda = 1 ranks only by probability of the term and lambda = 0 ranks only by lift (the ratio of a termâ€™s probability within a topic to its marginal probability across the corpus)."
