      "4.3 Days and expenditure substituted and attributed to the target species None of the 228 tourists interviewed stayed overnight at Chilika, and all tourists interviewed went on only one dolphin-watching ride.\n",
      "Thus the average number of days that tourists spent watching dolphins at Chilika was one day.\n",
      "The average number of days that dolphin-watching tourists spent in Odisha was 4.52 days .\n",
      "The average number of days that dolphin-watching tourists spent elsewhere in Odisha was 3.52 .\n",

      "39 tourists responded to our questions asking:  whether they would have visited Odisha if there had been no opportunity to watch dolphins at Chilika, and  if yes, how many days they would have spent in Odisha.\n",
      "The average number of days these tourists spent in Odisha was 4.54  and the average hypothetical number of days that they would have spent in Chilika if there were no dolphins was 0.46.\n",
      "We thus estimate that these tourists would have spent 0.33  fewer days in Odisha if there had been no opportunity to watch dolphins  and 0.21  \n",
      "We estimate that these tourists would have spent 38%  of their “lost” dolphin-watching time visiting geographically neighbouring sites in Odisha other than Chilika, and 62% outside Odisha; therefore the region would have lost valuable tourist visitation.\n",
      "Hence, if there was no opportunity to watch dolphins in Chilika, the number of days that tourists would have spent elsewhere in Odisha was estimated to be 3.65 , and the number of days spent in Odisha was estimated to be 4.31 .\n",
      "If there was no opportunity to watch dolphins in Chilika Lagoon, tourists would not spend money on dolphin-watching rides, and hence this expenditure would be lost to the Chilika economy.\n",
      "This figure considers the time spent elsewhere in Odisha, that was attributable to dolphins in Chilika , and represents the amount of money that tourists would have spent elsewhere in Odisha if there was no opportunity to watch dolphins at Chilika Lagoon.\n",
      "If dolphins were extirpated or unavailable for viewing, tourists would have spent approximately 38% of their “lost” dolphin-watching time visiting geographically neighbouring sites in Odisha other than Chilika and 62% outside Odisha.\n",
      "If sharks and Manta rays are important draw-cards for tourists to visit Palau and the Maldives respectively, unavailability of the target species is likely to result in larger expenditure losses to neighbouring tourist sites, and to the region, and hence the substituted value for both target species and the subsequent corrected attributable expenditure is likely to be higher than current valuation estimates.\n",
      "5.4 Future recommendations Future studies using this approach could be improved by:  interviewing tourists both before and after they go on a dolphin-watching ride, allowing tourists the opportunity to provide considered responses to all questions asked,  increasing the sample size of tourists interviewed,  ensuring that tourists answer all the interview questions, so that the corrected time and expenditure estimates are more accurate.\n",
