      "The paucity of research related to domestic medical tourism may be attributed to the widely accepted notion that medical tourists are primarily travelling across international borders .\n",
      "However, a broad definition of medical tourism reflects the primary purpose of travel for elective surgery .\n",
      "While it is acknowledged that there are varying definitions of medical tourism, this research subscribes to a broader interpretation of a medical tourist as someone who travels to a destination  outside their usual environment to undertake elective surgical treatment .\n",
      "Some studies have alluded to significant cost savings when medical tourists travel to less developing countries for medical tourism .\n",
      "For instance, insurance provider NIB launched a travel option for its clients to purchase to mitigate the risks of medical tourism .\n",
      "My understanding is that it refers to people who travel overseas for various medical procedures.”    “It means that people travel overseas for medical treatment because the costs are less than in Australia.”    “The term suggests medical and dental services offered cheaper offshore from Australia.”    These various quotes reflect the heavily skewed perspective of medical tourism towards an international orientation, and perhaps disassociated how such experiences could be envisaged within a domestic market.\n",
      "As the patients travel with family or friends, they may want to explore the area, so it can't be just only Australia Zoo and the beach…” Her views reiterate the propositions from existing literature that have argued for a diverse range of relevant and appropriate tourism activities to heighten the value proposition of selecting one medical tourism destination over another .\n",

      "We seek to determine what aviation and non-aviation factors influence decisions on predominantly leisure travel routes.\n",
      "In terms of price, leisure demand is much less elastic than that of business travellers .\n",
      "In this regard, Australia, with a large mature domestic travel market and tourism comprising one of its main economic powerhouses, is a suitable case study to understand domestic air route suspension.\n",
      "In most instances, this literature draws from the broader understanding of the determinants of air travel demand and the factors influencing travel in general, while other specific aviation-related matters are also worth analysing.\n",
      "1.2 Air route suspension factors The interconnectedness of air route suspension and traveller demand is doubtless key because air route suspension impacts directly on passengers' overall travel experience—particularly for the “time-sensitive” customers who otherwise would not have travelled by other means of transport—while at the same time lack of demand is a major factor in decisions to suspend routes.\n",
      "Based on the literature review undertaken for this study, a conceptual framework on the factors influencing traveller demand was developed .\n",
      "1 divides air travel demand factors using Calderón's  two primary groups of drivers to influence air travel demand: aviation and non-aviation related factors, the latter called “geo-economic” factors.\n",
      "In the case of Australia and other large continental countries, such as Brazil, Russia, India, Canada and the USA, the implementation of high-speed rail projects has been minimal or non-existent, leaving air transport with a predominant competitive advantage, particularly in terms of faster travel time and higher frequency compared with other modes of transport.\n",
      "In particular, population income relates to financial ability to travel, especially on leisure routes where business-sponsored trips are not preponderant.\n",
      "Economic and financial trends also influence airfare prices, which ultimately directly impact on affordability and likelihood of air travel.\n",
      "Population income is also directly linked to regional economic activities, such as mining, agriculture, tourism and industry, as well as to the corporate travel/freight market volume.\n",
      "If the regional economy of the outbound market is not prosperous or the country is undergoing an economic or political crisis, willingness to travel and corporate travel budgets will be affected, influencing domestic and international demand in both the leisure and business markets .\n",
      "Location affects demand in that the distance of the destination from the traveller's place of origin and the time spent in travelling both influence demand between competitor destinations.\n",
      "Institutional seasonality is related to living/cultural behaviour, such as school holidays, public holidays, the length of time available, the necessary travel gear, and motivation for travelling, such as events and festivals.\n",
      "This increase was due to population growth, tourism development and passengers who flew for the first time immediately after deregulation and were willing to pay more for air travel.\n",
      "He stated that “in the first one it is a business destination, where there was a mine; when the mine finishes its work life, the reason for travel to this specific destination will no longer exist and the route will fail.” This type of example occurs often in Australia because mining is one of the country's most important economic contributors.\n",
      "The second example is a leisure destination because according to Peter, “every tourist destination has a cycle where it grows and gets to a mature stage for a while and then starts to lose trendiness and becomes less attractive.” According to him, demand can be driven in a leisure market; however, a better understanding of this market is needed to invest in marketing strategically to the right potential traveller.\n",
      "Economic and social issues have a strong impact on both leisure and corporate traveller behaviour.\n",
      "In recent years, access to air travel has become easier because prices have become more reasonable.\n",
      "Sarah, from the Gold Coast airport, gave two other examples of socio-economic issues that have affected the domestic air travel market in Australia, notably the global financial crisis in 2008.\n",
      "Three other interviewees also mentioned economic factors as an important issue for air travel.\n",
      "Simon, from a South Australian DMO, believes their main role is to drive demand travel to the destination, focusing on marketing to maintain and increase the movement of travellers and consequently improve airlines' load factors.\n",
      "Maria from a Queensland DMO explained that because the region receives predominantly leisure travellers, the schools' holiday periods have much more demand than other times of the year.\n",
      "They also engage with travel agencies and airlines by supporting and promoting events.\n",

      "This can be achieved at every stage of tourist consumption, from information-gathering, travel decision-making, purchasing, destination selection and in the whole consumption process at the tourist destination.\n",

      "  1 Introduction The ability of visitors to travel around destination areas is crucial for tourism, yet this mobility brings many problems, particularly to sensitive rural destinations where the infrastructure is often ill-suited to the large scale influx of seasonal visitors.\n",
      "Studies have tended to focus on identifying key characteristics, be they demographic or attitudinal, which predict modal choice, while few studies attempt to unravel the social assumptions and discourses that underlie travel behaviour decisions.\n",
      "This study applies Moscovici's  framework of social representations to an analysis of tourism travel problems in order to examine how representations of travel problems support particular travel practices that are contingent on an individual's contextual position.\n",
      "Firstly the paper adds to the understanding of how and why travel decisions are made.\n",
      "A social representations framework suggests that people's views of transport modes and travel are, in part, socially derived.\n",
      "The authors developed a conceptual framework to explain the role of social representations in travel behaviour .\n",
      "People develop views based on their own past experiences of travel but views are also developed through social interaction and the influence of mass media.\n",
      "Thus an individual's representation of a particular travel problem will be constructed from a combination of the individual's experience and the collective ideas that circulate in society about the problem.\n",
      "As transport is a contested topic, there are many recognised dilemmas and contradictions relating to travel and travel behaviour, some come to dominate for certain groups and others remain subordinate.\n",
      "This study started from the perspective that there was a travel problem to address in rural destination areas.\n",
      "As the study progressed it became clear that not everyone shared the perspective that there was a travel problem to address and this has important implications for initiatives aiming to affect modal shift and address tourism congestion problems.\n",
      "Rural areas also have an increasingly mobile, car dependent population travelling to centres of employment and services outside the area, while the landscape is seen as a leisure space and draws in a visiting population.\n",
      "Purbeck was selected as a study area due to its rural nature, dramatic natural setting, thriving tourism industry and acute seasonal travel problems.\n",
      "Within the last ten years the local authority and other organisations have commissioned a number of consultancy reports and funded a variety of transport initiatives yet seasonal travel problems remain and most schemes show limited success as is common elsewhere.\n",
      "Transport problems in rural destination areas occur at two broad levels: global environmental issues and local travel problems.\n",
      "While air travel is the most problematic component long domestic journeys by car are also very significant .\n",
      "On a global scale much of the environmental impact accrues through travel to, rather than within, destination areas .\n",
      "However, while local travel is more minor, in relation to global dimensions such as climate change, it creates significant local problems which should not be overlooked .\n",
      "The local tourism transport problem is the result of the combined effect of different groups’ competing needs for travel: tourists’ journey from home to destination on day of arrival and departure; day-visitors’ journey from home to destination; journeys in the destination area undertaken by tourists and residents for leisure purposes; and utility journeys undertaken in the destination by visitors and residents such as food shopping.\n",
      "There are also issues with the policy agenda with less government interest in leisure travel in the UK compared to commuting and the school run which receives much more attention .\n",
      "Studies also arise from spatial geography and a logistics tradition which focuses on quantifying the trips and the travel characteristics which predict modal choice, but pays little attention to the social conceptions of transport and the social reality that shapes travel behaviour .\n",
      "In order to explore these aspects a more holistic study was undertaken in Purbeck to gain a more contextual understanding of travel as it takes place within a destination.\n",
      "Earlier papers have analysed this material to explore how social representations explain travel decisions .\n",
      "Here analysis develops these aspects by focusing on travel problems and the residents’ behavioural response and integrating these findings with those from stages two and three.\n",
      "The second stage explored travel patterns and travel behaviour of visitors to the area through the use of 40 travel diaries completed during summer 2004.\n",
      "This produced largely quantitative information on: travel patterns, modal choice, trip chaining, purpose of journeys, attractions and places visited.\n",
      "Posters advertising and explaining the travel diaries were put up in prominent positions on each campsite and leaflets distributed to visitors.\n",
      "The design of the travel diary was based on a German study  and the UK National Travel Survey .\n",
      "In an earlier paper , analysis focused on whether visitors are constrained by the objective reality of travel opportunities or their social representation of transport and it was concluded that representations play a powerful role.\n",
      "Finally as the travel diary focused on visitors staying at campsites, a questionnaire survey was undertaken with visitors at various attractions in the area during summer 2005 .\n",
      "Among other things, data were compiled on people's explanations for travel behaviour, the problems encountered and responses to these problems by employing open questioning techniques.\n",
      "Cluster analysis was employed to identify groups of respondents based on their explanations for car travel.\n",
      "At 9.00 round the school times, it's a nightmare… when I worked I travelled west of here towards Dorchester and quite honestly it was a waste of time me bothering to go between 8.15 and 9.15 because I wouldn’t get to work any earlier because you get stuck in the school traffic .\n",
      "The basic problem of rurality was also cited as a reason for high car usage: I’m afraid we very much rely on cars for our transport as so many people do… young people living here have virtually got to have a car it's very unlikely that the train will take them conveniently just to where they work and it's a big problem… one of the major problems with the motor car and all this congestion is the very great distances that people travel to work and I just don’t know what the answer is I mean this link with housing, people with a desire to live out in the country .\n",
      "Though the exploratory research with residents revealed an emphasis on local travel problems, that is typical of the tourism impacts literature , residents’ views were mixed on this.\n",
      "4.2 Visitor travel The travel diaries and visitor attraction survey revealed that car use by visitors is high in Purbeck .\n",
      "For the purpose of analysing car travel behaviour decisions those categories used by less than 10% of the respondents in the survey were excluded as has been suggested elsewhere .\n",
      "For instance, interviews and travel diaries revealed there is a discourse that public transport should be used and would be but for the fact that it is expensive relative to the car at point of use and difficult to use .\n",
      "The findings of this cluster analysis are not intended as a typology of motorists or travellers as per the work of Anable  and Dallen , but serve as heuristic for further discussion.\n",
      "The largest group  love the car and embrace positive features of car travel.\n",
      "In a similar vein, a German study of holiday travel  also questions the use of alternatives even where people express positive views.\n",
      "Most had never travelled by train on holiday and mentioned at least one problem  which stopped them travelling by train.\n",
      "As a result, fewer participants than anticipated encountered problems travelling around the area and several commented that the road conditions for driving were surprisingly good.\n",
      "The travel diaries revealed that congestion was encountered on only 42 out of 844 trips recorded.\n",
      "This tends to suggest travel conditions are less favourable for bus users and cyclists.\n",
      "Comments at the end of the questionnaire suggest some visitors had expectations of problems particularly on good weather days and others had amended their travel plans, usually by setting off early, to avoid problems they might encounter.\n",
      "While resident interviews show residents recognise local travel problems, the travel diaries and visitor attraction survey revealed that car-based visitors had fewer concerns.\n",
      "Firstly, poor weather conditions during the later part of the travel diary implementation period may have reduced the incidence of problems encountered.\n",
      "By examining visitor travel behaviour decisions, the coping mechanisms adopted by residents and visitors, and contrasting the travel problems encountered, this study has explored how ideas about transport and tourism are to a large extent context contingent and shaped by the collective ideas that circulate in society .\n",
      "This suggests policy measures should not target tourists  but instead focus on travel behaviour in general.\n",
      "Becken  argues that air travel has become highly valued for the perceived freedom it brings and that only major societal changes would lead to reduced air travel and this is also the case with car-based travel to and around destination areas.\n",
      "There is therefore much greater scope to make the link between the place and visitor travel behaviour through the use of interpretation.\n",
      "There is a long way to go before residents and visitors will be enticed from their cars, but as global and local travel problems increase people will be looking for alternatives and positive experiences of high quality alternatives to the car may alter how ideas about transport and tourism are constructed in a destination context.\n",

      "7 SoCoMo marketing in travel and tourism SoCoMo marketing strategies are ideal for tourists because they are usually unfamiliar with the local environment and conditions.Consequently they may not have favourite suppliers and are open to suggestions that can enhance their experience.\n",
      "This information needs to be timely, ready and relevant throughout all stages of the travel experience, including travel planning, booking, on vacation and after the trip .\n",
      "SoCoMo marketing can support tourists and tourism organisations therefore to co-create products and services within the context of the travel experience.\n",
      "SoCoMo will not only facilitate co-creation between industry and travellers but will also empower the peer-to-peer economy.\n",
      "Increasingly travellers communicate with each other on a peer-to-peer basis, through open social media platforms such as Trip Advisor, twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as various forums to discuss travel arrangements, to exchange ideas and tips, and to support each other׳s travel experience.\n",
      "There are also a number of travel companies, such as Lonely Planet and booking.com, which have incorporated peer-to-peer information-sharing into their web sites and already engage their audience in conversations and interaction on tourism and travel-specific topics .\n",
      "Airbnb users include hosts and travellers.\n",
      "Hosts list and rent out their unused spaces and travellers search for and book accommodation worldwide.\n",
      "The system detects travellers׳ location and connects them with the nearest driver.\n",
      "The app texts travellers when the driver arrives and they can check the identity of the driver against who actually shows up.\n",
      "They can be easily co-created to address the particular context of the traveller.\n",
      "By sending targeted and highly context-relevant information and offers to mobile devices in the destination at the right time, tourism providers and marketers can enhance tourist experiences and make travellers aware of information that was unforeseen before their trip .\n",
      "Marketers can help travellers cope with unexpected situations in the destination, such as bad weather, heavy traffic or even accidents and emergencies by guiding their travel experience with suggestions for alternative routes, activities and sights.\n",
      "This value-added information is likely to motivate tourists to make better informed but also more spontaneous travel-related decisions within the destination and consequently opt for more SoCoMo applications in the near future.\n",
      "8 Challenges of SoCoMo marketing in travel and tourism With the enhanced opportunities come a number of challenges that businesses intending to adopt SoCoMo marketing need to consider in their strategy.\n",
      "SoCoMo marketing will enable local service providers and destinations to generate context-specific solutions that address the individual needs of travellers dynamically through a combination of personalisation based on pre-set preferences, social media interactions and learning through patterns of behaviour.\n",
      "There is a need for dynamic communication with individual consumers before, during and after their travelling experience .\n",
      "Producing brochures and marketing campaigns is simply not adequate in the era of connectivity, when consumers engage in dynamic dialogue in order to co-create their travel experiences.\n",
      "SoCoMo marketing therefore is the beginning of a whole new era of mobile-based, agile tourism marketing, that will revolutionise the tourism production by enabling tourists to co-create their experiences in real-time, based on context-relevant information and social networking at all stages of their travel experiences.\n",
      "There is also a need to further explore the various influences SoCoMo marketing may have on the travel behaviour and how this affects the performance of tourism businesses.\n",

      "The suspicion is, that many, if not most, people who travel overseas for medical services are primarily motivated by their need for treatment, rather than a desire to have a holiday.\n",
      "And it is fair to say that the overall emphasis to date of most medical tourism research has been on the medical aspects of travel, rather than tourist behaviour.\n",
      "Connell  suggests conceptualising all cross-border mobility for medical care as ‘medical travel’ rather than ‘medical tourism’.\n",
      "For the purposes of this paper, we adhere to the term medical tourism, despite its contested nature, and adopt the U.S.-based Medical Tourism Association  definition: “[P]eople who live in one country travel to another country to receive medical, dental and surgical care while at the same time receiving equal to or greater care than they would have in their own country, and are travelling for medical care because of affordability, better access to care or a higher level of quality of care.” In this paper we draw on our qualitative study of medical tourists from New Zealand who sought treatment abroad and focus on their expectations, experiences and reflections on the leisure component of their stay abroad.\n",
      "We document what types of tourist experiences are sought and explore whether these differ from what other leisure travellers may experience.\n",
      "2 Literature review  2.1 The role of tourism vs. treatment Uchida , in a similar way to Connell  considers medical tourism as an inappropriate term “because those who travel internationally are patients, not tourists for shopping and a pleasurable holiday”.\n",
      "Presenting a medical perspective, Nahai  in a paper entitled It's procedure, not tourism, argues that travelling abroad for a medical procedure simply cannot be considered a vacation.\n",
      "Likewise, Chow, Pires and Rosenberger  prefer ‘international medical travel’ as preferable to medical tourism – as, in their view, it potentially provides a more accurate understanding of medical tourism decision making.\n",
      "They stress that travel for medical treatment or procedure is the core service being offered, while tourism activities are one of its supplementary benefits.\n",
      "They propose that motivators for medical travel may be: procedure based; cost based; time based; or travel based, the latter focusing on the benefits of having a tourism experience together with the medical services.\n",
      "It is important to note, however, that Fetscherin and Stephano's sample did not comprise current medical tourists, nor people specifically considering medical travel, but was drawn from the general population.\n",
      "While some researchers have downplayed the role of leisure tourism in medical tourism destination choice and decision making  others have identified the possibility that motivations for medical tourists can be travel based  .\n",
      "The dedicated medical tourist is “… someone who made the decision to seek treatment prior to departure, and who also identified seeking treatment as the main reason, or as equally important a reason as a holiday for pleasure, for their travel decision … The holidaying medical tourist identified a vacation as the main reason to travel and also pre-planned to undergo treatment at their destination” .\n",
      "To some extent then, the study reported on in this paper complements Wongkit and McKercher's, where we focus on the centrality, or otherwise, of the holiday experience in the medical travels of participants.\n",
      "In essence, Cohen  identifies two broad types of medical tourist: those who travel explicitly for medical treatment, and those who combine a holiday with treatment.\n",
      "However, in Wongkit and McKercher's 2013 study  almost 90% of dedicated medical tourists travelled both to receive treatment and “for the chance to explore new places and cultures”, however, the authors do not report on the actual leisure activities pursued by their participants .\n",
      "Musa, Thirumoorthi, and Doshi  in one of the few studies of the actual travel behaviours of medical tourists, undertaken in Malaysia, reported that 17.4% of their survey's participants engaged in shopping and 21.0% in touring.\n",
      "2.3 Influence of travelling companions While some medical tourists may travel alone, they are often accompanied by caregivers, usually family or friends.\n",
      "Some medical tourists travelling for cosmetic surgery go in small groups, who may include friends and/or strangers.\n",
      "Such travel companions, Connell argues, “fit more easily into a more conventional tourist mode” .\n",
      "Friends and family may provide a demand for, and help facilitate, a conventional holiday, and similarly, travelling with a group of patients may foster a holiday atmosphere.\n",
      "From this brief coverage of the literature, it is clear, that we need to know more about how medical tourists see themselves, and whether this is “as patients, travellers or tourists – or some fluid combination of these”  There is also a need for more research which focuses on the importance of the tourism aspects of medical travel including the role of the hospital in providing and/or promoting a holiday experience for either the patient or the travelling care-giver.\n",
      "The role  of conventional tourism experiences within medical tourism, or at least the uneven way in which tourism is manifested in medical travel, is similar to some other forms of ‘non-leisure’ travel.\n",
      "Connell  sees similarities with VFR , diaspora and MICE  tourism, however, business travel is where the greatest commonality may lie.\n",
      "Hall  describes business travel as a work-oriented form of tourism, which is not connected to leisure-tourism, and similarly Urry  argues that motivations for business and leisure tourists are different: for business, mainly, to meet people; for leisure tourists, to see the place itself.\n",
      "And although we commonly use the term business travel rather than business tourism, the two are often used interchangeably.\n",
      "While this is yet to generate a high level of concern among either researchers, destination managers or other business tourism/travel stakeholders, Serdiuk  distinguishes between leisure and business in a model where the degree of focus on work, length of stay, and mode of travel  are the defining criteria.\n",
      "Business tourism includes more leisure-oriented business trips, for a longer period of time and including part leisure and business-related activities, whereas business travel is defined as more business-oriented short trips that encompass not only business-related activities, but other travel experiences .\n",
      "Conference participation, a specific form of business travel, perhaps shares some characteristics with travel for a medical procedure in terms of its time frame and level of intensity ; the leisure component is variable, Jago and Deery  claiming that only 20% of conference delegates usually visit organized events and that they usually spend too short a time at the destination to enjoy it.\n",
      "The researchers travelled to the location of the participants to undertake the interviews in a location of their choice.\n",
      "Our sample comprised eighteen New Zealanders who had travelled overseas for medical treatment.\n",
      "Participants included those travelling for cardiac surgery, renal surgery, orthopaedic surgery, breast augmentation and other cosmetic surgeries, radiotherapy, in-vitro fertilisation , medical screening and dental treatment .\n",
      "We purposefully excluded those travelling for ‘wellness’  spa, yoga and similar treatments, as there is evidence to suggest that they are distinct from medical tourists .\n",
      "Our participants included two family members who were the travelling companions of the person receiving the medical treatment.\n",
      "Our participants who were travelling for cosmetic surgery generally placed a higher priority on having a holiday while in the destination, in the knowledge that they would be able to do so.\n",
      "Sometimes such advice was passed on by word of mouth from friends or family who had travelled for such a procedure or who know someone who had done so.\n",
      "Barbara and Earnest a couple in their 40s travelling together for cosmetic surgeries had well planned post-procedure holidays in Thailand.\n",
      "Their holiday expectations were based upon their previous travel to Thailand for related medical procedures.\n",
      "David, in his 50s travelled to the Philippines for dental treatment where he “… hired a driver for the day … did the entire tourist thing”.\n",
      "Quentin, in his 50s, travelled to India for cardiac treatment.\n",
      "Even those travelling for cosmetic procedures were subject to complications.\n",
      "Fiona, in her 50s travelled to Malaysia for cosmetic surgery.\n",
      "Barbara had to stay a minimum of ten days to get the stitches out from her cosmetic surgery, so for her the obvious question was “so why not tie it in with a holiday?” Conversely, Bruce, who travelled to the UK for his cosmetic procedure had self-dissolving stitches so there was no medical reason compelling him to stay longer in the destination.\n",
      "Charles, in his 50s, travelled to France for cardiac surgery, and his surgeon required him to stay for a month after the operation; “You could hop on the plane but once you're in Europe you hang around.\n",
      "Once in India,  She [the IVF specialist] needed to see me at the time of one [menstrual] cycle and then she didn't need to see me for two or three weeks … so we thought well, that two or three weeks we can go travelling around India … because it was [partner's] first trip so we did the whole tourism thing with him … She [specialist] didn't mind, she said just go have fun.\n",
      "Vita, for example, in reference to her and her partner's Indian holiday, wonders if the travelling around after the IVF treatment was a contributing factor to its initial failure “We travelled.\n",
      "and I don't know, maybe that could be a factor, the fact that I'm travelling, sure I don't lug any luggage or anything, [partner] did all that.\n",
      "Colin, who travelled to France described how “You get your own ward - a two bedroom ward … and my wife was able to go and stay in the other bed in the ward for a small fee … and receive meals as well”, a very hotel like experience.\n",
      "4.2 Personal factors Three personal factors were identified as influencing the holiday experiences of participants; travel experience/history; personality/resilience; and accompanying family/friends.\n",
      "Travel experience refers to the previous travel experiences of participants – where they had been and when-their travel career.\n",
      "Andrew who travelled to India with his wife for fertility treatment, recounted that he “… was quite curious about the country”, and that “My wife was quite keen to show me different parts of India”.\n",
      "He recounted his experiences of travelling as a child and had looked forward to recreating those experiences  bargain hunting in markets.\n",
      "Similarly, Quentin had, as a young man, travelled to India and to Delhi-which is why he chose Delhi for the operation.\n",
      "Fiona, who had travelled widely, had, however, not been to Malaysia, so thought she would get her cosmetic surgery there.\n",
      "Roger, a New Zealander, lived in France and travelled for a holiday to Goa in India each winter; thus his choice of India for his ongoing yearly dental treatment.\n",
      "Those who travelled alone were less likely to engage in a range of normally expected holiday behaviour.\n",
      "It seems that travelling companions provided both help in recovery  and the motivation to behave in a more conventionally touristic way.\n",
      "We asked Peter, in his 70s, who actually did travel to Australia for cancer treatment  if he felt he was having a holiday or whether he was constantly aware that he was there because of his cancer.\n",
      "4.3 Destination factors To some extent, destination factors are partly addressed in the discussion above regarding the travel experience/history of participants – in that the travel histories and travel aspirations in some cases determined the destination which then determined the type of holiday that would or could be available, depending upon other factors such as post-treatment outcomes, including complications.\n",
      "So the influence of the destination itself is within a causal chain between travel aspirations and medical treatment outcomes.\n",
      "Most participants seemed to have factored any holiday expenses in to their overall costs- and in reality, the cost of any tourism activity is likely to only a small percentage of the overall cost of the medical travel, the actual procedure usually being, by far, the most expensive item .\n",
      "Kasim, an Indian expat living in New Zealand travelled to India for kidney surgery.\n",
      "Apart from a few, the leisure tourism component of participants' medical travel was relatively unimportant, with decision making very much based upon factors relating to the medical procedure .\n",
      "For our dental tourist who travels to India each year or so for a holiday and ties this in with a visit to a dentist there, while the holiday itself is his primary motivation, his fortuitous discovery of a cheap and reliable dentist at the destination adds another layer of motivation and meaning to his holidays in India.\n",
      "Other participants, notably those who were travelling for cosmetic surgery, generally placed a higher priority on having a holiday while in the destination.\n",
      "Barbara and Earnest, as noted above, travelling together for cosmetic surgeries, had well planned out post-procedure holidays in Thailand.\n",
      "The mix of motivations underlying medical tourism does present some similarities with business travel, in terms of the intentionality of the leisure component, which for some business travellers is important, while for others it is less so, and when occurring is somewhat opportunistic, in the nature of Davidson's  ‘leisure extenders’.\n",
      "The continuum that Serdiuk  identifies between the business tourism and business travel experience may have a parallel in a medical tourism-medical travel continuum, the important question being whether or not there are essential differences in the leisure component between the two, and if so, what those differences are.\n",
      "Our participants described a range of leisure tourism experiences, mostly undertaken post-medical procedure, that for some were indistinguishable from a ‘normal’ holiday, but for others this differed in terms of the participant's capacity to enjoy their time while recovering from a medical procedure, suffering a degree of post-procedure pain or discomfort, being on medication, and having limited mobility, either physically, or in terms of risking travelling too far from the clinic/hospital.\n",
      "The presence or lack of a supporting partner or family member to holiday with also impacted upon the nature of their leisure travel component.\n",
      "These variables could be used to delineate a medical tourism/travel continuum.\n",
      "But even though some may travel for life-saving medical interventions, it is still clear that there may be hedonic pleasures – whether these are intentional or not – associated with such travel.\n",
      "So, in a similar way to Serdiuk's  observation that we cannot claim that leisure is always a part of business travel , we cannot claim that leisure activities are always a part of medical tourism.\n",
      "The accidental or unpredictable nature of the leisure component may provoke challenges for the individual medical tourist, for their travelling family/friends, and also possibly for the medical provider in terms of ensuring that post-procedure leisure tourism behaviours do not take the patient out of contact from the provider, or imperil their recovery.\n",
      "When such help is absent, however, for example where the client is self-booking or relying upon a non-specialised traditional travel agent, this poses challenges in reconciling tourism expectations against medically imposed constraints.\n",

      "Given the critical role of technology in enabling co-creation between the customer and the firm, we focus on the customer expending operant resources such as time, effort, knowledge, and prior travel experience in order to co-create a tourism package.\n",

      "We manipulated co-creation situations at two levels  by allowing customers to customize various options, such as inter-city travel, accommodation, local sightseeing and travel, other activities, and food .\n",
      "We also manipulated the experience condition by telling participants that the overall experience with regard to above travel elements was either good or bad.\n",

      "Sustainability communication sets out to make consumers aware of the availability of sustainable travel products, to inform consumers how these offerings meet their needs and comply with sustainability criteria, and ultimately to stimulate pro-sustainable purchases.\n",

      "Other communication channels mainly refer to the image effects of destinations or events , different forms of print information   travel magazines or press coverage , online advertising , sustainability reporting , destination brochures , or restaurant information .\n",

      "Additionally, modern and postmodern sociological theories may contribute to explaining travel choices through the lens of consumerism and commodification.\n",
      "Also largely unexplored is how well sustainability communication can present sustainable tourism products as symbolic functions that give people a sense of status or self-identity  or “a counter-identity”  suggesting a positive status for those who travel sustainably ; make social inequalities visible ; help create meaning ; and respond to the concepts of  lifestyles and social practices .\n",

      "Consequently, tourism demand “varies depending on whether travel distance increases or decreases” , “rising to a peak at some distance relatively close to a source market and then declining exponentially as distance increases” .\n",
      "In particular, the paper provides an exploration of whether travel distance between tourists׳ place of residence and the wine region, along with other consumer characteristics , can predict wine tourism motivations, as well as expenditure patterns of winery visitors.\n",
      "With respect to the travel distance, respondents were asked to indicate their place of residence.\n",
      "In terms of their place of residence, almost 44.0% of the visitors to Northern Greek wineries were residents of Thessaloniki , with the majority of them  having traveled less than 100km to visit the wine region.\n",
      "It rather indicates a travel characteristic, unconnected to wine lifestyle.\n",
      "Following, Hierarchical Multiple Regression Analysis was conducted to examine whether travel distance – entered in Step 2 can add to the ability of all other predictors – entered in Step 1- to explain each one of the eight criterion variables selected for this study .\n",
      "4.3.1 Distance as a predictor of wine tourism motivations Empirical findings  reveal that travel distance significantly explains the variance of the following motivating factors: ‘Socialization’ ; ‘Destination attractiveness’ ; and ‘Core wine product’ .\n",
      "In the case of ‘Educational experience’ the inclusion of travel distance in Step 2 resulted in change of R 2 .\n",
      "Moreover, the values of standardized beta  indicate that travel distance has the most important effect in  in ‘Destination attractiveness’.\n",
      "The inclusion of travel distance at the second step of the regression resulted in a statistically significant change in the coefficient of determination =13.258, p<0.001).\n",
      "Thus, travel distance explains 33.0% of the unique variance in wine purchasing at the cellar door.\n",
      "A further examination of the coefficient matrix suggests that product involvement is the most influential predictor of purchasing , followed by travel distance .\n",
      "This finding supports the significance of distance in influencing consumers׳ decisions to travel to a specific wine region .\n",
      "In particular, results indicate that tourists who travel longer distances to visit a wine region attach more importance to destination attributes  compared to short‐haul travelers.\n",
      "Travel distance was negatively associated with the importance of the incentive ‘Socialization’, implying that, compared to long haul travelers, visitors who live close to the winery tend to primarily focus on the social benefits of wine leisure activities.\n",
      "5.3 Antecedents of purchasing at the cellar door Despite that the inclusion of travel distance at the second step of the regression added to the predicting ability of the model, product involvement remained the most influential independent predictor of purchasing.\n",
      "Research findings confirm Getz and Brown׳s  proposition that “a consumer׳s very perception of what constitutes a wine region for travel purposes will be based on much more than the simple presence of vineyards and wineries”.\n",
      "6.3 Limitations and further research directions A major implication of this work concerns the positive link found between travel distance and wine purchasing at the cellar door.\n",
      "Yet, it has to be stressed that the overwhelming majority of visitors to Northern Greek wineries  had travelled less than 500km to visit the wine region, a distance approximately equal to that between Athens and Thessaloniki.\n",
      "Additional indices,  time invested in displacement; travel cost or perceived distance;  could be further used to better estimate the effect of distance on wine related travel.\n",

      "The most popular responses were: travelling with appropriate clothing , registering at the mountain huts, carrying a first aid kit, using a map and hiking experience.\n",
      "The survey also questioned whether or not participants travelled with a guide or carried a mobile or satellite phone and if someone was aware of their location .\n",

      "Some participants stated they received information from local residents, from the outdoor travel association magazine ‘Utivist’ and in class at high school.\n",
      "Considering that  most participants were not travelling with a guide,  network coverage to mobile phones is inconsistent and  very few participants carried a satellite phone, mountain hut registration will be an essential element for emergency response capabilities in locating and accounting for every individual during an extreme event.\n",

      "4.1 Study One: Textual analysis of online discourse Results from the textual analysis of online information retrieved using keyword searches in Google revealed a broad cross-section of tourism industry marketing literature, community websites, destination review websites and unsolicited travel information.\n",
      "Of these, six were tour operators or tourism industry websites, 13 were privately owned or community websites, 11 were destination review or trip advisory websites where individuals could post blogs or comments about a destination, and seven were private blogs containing unsolicited travel information from past experiences of Nimbin.\n",

      "2.3 Medical tourism and spillover effects Medical tourism initially emerged from “health tourism” that involves travel outside one's natural health care jurisdiction for the enhancement or restoration of the individual's health through wellness and medical treatments .\n",
      "Thus, “medical tourism” has been conceptualized as something of an umbrella term which many promoters of tourism have uncritically accepted and associated with travelers in search of better health inclusive of not only necessary and elective medical  procedures, but also wellness therapies bundled with services for lodging, entertainment, food and beverage, and touring or exploring the attractions of a destination .\n",
      "Governments have played a role in further destination marketing and effectively linked medical tourism into broader health tourism that connects invasive medical procedures to rejuvenation, healthy living, and the accommodation for recuperation  Despite questionable use of medical terminology, medical tourism describes a niche form of sustainable tourism and has its own segmented-marketing mechanisms for health services and tourism activities in which travelers are intended to engage upon travel to a particular destination .\n",
      "With the great variation in the complexity, delivery, accreditation, and overall quality of experience in medical facilities abroad, along with the increasing popularity of domestic health and wellness travel within the United States for consumers seeking alternative therapies and second opinions from qualified United States providers, it should be noted that more countries and medical providers recognize the potential for new business in the US; and Las Vegas is one of the first markets positioned to attract medical tourism to consumers.\n",

      "However, the CC group treated travel as a way to make memories, attached great importance to local culture and history, and showed a less strong preference for the world's most famous and popular destinations.\n",
      "With regards to familiarity, the CC were comfortable with unfamiliar locations, foods, people, and languages; the MCC prefered travel destinations that they knew fairly well to avoid being nervous and anxious.\n",
      "This conforms to Plog's  findings that Hong Kong travelers are near-psychocentric with a dependable personality and who prefer something familiar.\n",
      "The two travel motivation factors were also found to be statistically different: to seek different experiences  and to relax .\n",
      "In this sense, it is not surprising that the CC tended to be more independent and made their own travel decisions  .\n",
      "On average, the CC planned a trip over two months before traveling, somewhat earlier than the HKC and MCC at 1.5 months.\n",
      "A similar pattern can be noticed for travel booking .\n",
      "The MCC were more likely to acquire travel information from traditional channels .\n",
      "The CC  preferred to book accommodation before traveling, more so compared to the HKC  and MCC .\n",
      "The HKC  and MCC  were more likely to book travel packages that include accommodation and other services together.\n",
      "5.2.2 During trip analysis No statistical differences were found for the trip duration and travel companion.\n",
      "Most of the three groups preferred to travel during the summer months , for one to four days with their family members  or friends .\n",
      "They did not like to travel alone  and even less with an organized group .\n",
      "The CC  and HKC  preferred air travel, while the MCC  showed a preference for train trips.\n",
      "Both HKC and MCC groups were more likely to take package tours, thus fewer purchased meals during travel.\n",
      "With regard to information acquisition while traveling, the CC  preferred to ask service staff in hotels, restaurants or bars, while the MCC  were more likely to obtain it from a travel information center.\n",
      "5.2.3 Post-trip analysis As shown in  Table 6, all three groups were highly satisfied with the previous trip taken , but there was a significant difference with respect to perceived value  and recommendation intention, indicating that the MCC group  was more willing to recommend their travel experience to others compared to the other two groups .\n",
      "These differences have important implications for destination management organizations  and suppliers when designing travel products for domestic Chinese immigrant travelers or targeting them in promotional activities.\n",
      "For example, if a subject increases his/her agreement with the statement 'I plan my pleasure travel around visiting the world's most famous sites and destinations' by one point , the odds ratio of being in the CC, HKC or MCC group rather than the reference group would be 99.9%, 171.5%, and 247.7% higher, respectively , while holding all other variables in the model constant.\n",
      "If a subject makes travel decisions with family members instead of with others , the odds ratio of a subject being in the HKC or MCC group rather than the CAC group is 161.2% and 228.4% higher, respectively , while holding all other variables in the model constant.\n",
      "This means that MCC's travel decision can be greatly influenced by their family members compared to the CAC.\n",
      "In addition to these two different behaviors, the HKC are less likely to book performing arts tickets before traveling and acquire information at destinations from service staff in hotels, restaurants or bars compared to the CAC.\n",
      "However, they prefer booking with a travel agency through the web, with a tour operator both online and offline, or directly with the airline.\n",
      "For the MCC, they are less likely to travel by plane but prefer taking trains compared to the CAC.\n",
      "Additionally, they favor booking travel packages with a travel agency both online and offline, a tour operator through the web, through an online travel agent like Travelocity or Expedia, or through a destination website both online and offline.\n",
      "This study examined the tourist behaviors of three ethnic Chinese groups, and all three hypotheses were supported:  Canadian-born Chinese, Chinese immigrants born in Hong Kong, and Chinese immigrants born in Mainland China have different tourist behaviors, indicating that the ethnic Chinese market is not homogeneous;  the Chinese immigrants born in Mainland China, who assimilated the most Chinese traditional culture, show the most extreme differences in behavior from Caucasian Canadians compared to the Chinese immigrants born in Hong Kong, who have combined Asian and Western culture;  the travel patterns of Canadian-born Chinese, who have been exposed to Western culture since birth, are quite similar to the general Canadian population.\n",
      "Generally speaking, the MCC like to make travel decisions with their family members and choose destinations with which they are familiar.\n",
      "The HKC's travel decisions are more often influenced by their friends.\n",
      "Additionally, the HKC accept unfamiliar destinations but still prefer Chinese food when traveling.\n",
      "The CC behave more like the Caucasian Canadians, who value individualism and want to experience relaxation through traveling.\n",
      "For instance, even though both HKC and MCC like to book travel packages, they prefer Cantonese-speaking and Mandarin-speaking tour guides, respectively.\n",
      "These differences may also be important in the brochures, travel books or guides that are produced and it would be more appropriate to use materials aimed at the outbound Hong Kong and Mainland China markets than those prepared for the Caucasian domestic market.\n",
      "Unlike the CC and CAC, HKC and MCC tend to purchase 'standardized and quality-controlled' travel packages 'comprising two or more elements of transport, accommodation, food, destination attractions, other facilities and services' .\n",
      "Their cultural values  are a key motivator of this travel package purchase behavior .\n",
      "Tour operators need to obtain information on the safety and security at destinations from the regional and local destination marketing organizations as well as other relevant destination specific information for travelers who purchase a travel package.\n",
      "For HKC and MCC the best referral source is family, which significantly influences the travel decision-making process.\n",
      "It would thus be beneficial for tour operators and travel agencies to solicit both formal and informal feedback from their customers, offer referral discounts, and request a referral from tourists satisfied with the services and trips that they offer.\n",
      "Additionally, this study effectively extends Wang's  research into Chinese immigrants’ consumer behavior in Canada to include their travel behavior.\n",

      "Academic research on nature-based tourism has investigated different aspects of eco-tourist travel behavior and behavioral intention .\n",
      "In particular, the framework proposes that environmental attitudes can change as a result of the ecotravel experience.\n",
      "In an eco-travel context, the evaluation of tourists' experiences depends on their feeling regarding the eco site and the services provided .\n",
      "In a tourism context, travel sites generate positive feelings to tourists and this existential authenticity leaves them with positive impressions .\n",
      "After traveling, they will retain certain memories.\n",
      "This experience influences the cognition and emotion of travelers, which leads to positive environmental behavior .\n",
      "The researchers noticed that the changing behavior of tourists is related to their cognition and affection concerning travel sites.\n",
      "As a result, their travel experience helps us to understand their attitude to ecotourism.\n",
      "From this perspective it can be argued that tourists' overall travel experience would have an impact on their attitude towards ecotourism and, consequently, environmental behavior.\n",
      "Different travel sites offer diverse experiential values to tourists.\n",
      "The experience is generated through the contact with and appreciation of the eco-travel site.\n",
      "In the research framework, perceived value and activity involvement represent the cognitive dimension of attitude, while satisfaction with the travel eco-travel experience constitutes the affective part of attitude.\n",
      "In the tourism literature, perceived value is frequently conceptualized as the personal evaluation of the characteristics of travel products, such as service quality, price, emotions and social factors .\n",
      "These factors determine whether product value is worth consumption and influence tourist satisfaction after traveling .\n",
      "Reid and Crompton  also believed that the extent of involvement is a key variable in leisure behavior; for instance, people who like to travel will pay more attention to relevant travel information, so involvement is the concern expressed by tourists toward the characteristics and types of leisure activities that they engage in, and these factors result in different perception responses.\n",
      "Thus, for tourists, involvement is their main interest or emphasis in regard to their choice of travel activities.\n",
      "Therefore, in terms of leisure behavior, differences in involvement generally arise from differences in individual cognition and stimulation generated by travel activity.\n",
      "Involvement shows that tourist leisure behavior involves personal travel preferences, which influence choices in regard to participation of leisure activities, and involvement also influences different views toward participation in leisure activities.\n",
      "In a travel context, the measurement of satisfaction is based on pre-travel expectations of tourists, and the actual formation of positive feelings for the destination during or after the travel consumption process .\n",
      "Similarly, Tain-Cole and Cromption  describe satisfaction as a psychological outcome that is affective in nature and results from a positive travel experience.\n",
      "Kang and Moscardo  see environmentally responsible behavior as a consequence of environmental attitudes, and measure it in terms of behavioral norms in ecotourism regions, such as collecting information on destinations before travel and following behavioral norms.\n",
      "Researchers have also explored the relationship of place attachment, defined as the traveler's experience with the travel site, on individual travel behavior .\n",
      "studied tourists in three ecological areas and found that levels of environmentally responsible behavior varied, depending on the types of travel motivation .\n",
      "When the travel experience produces positive feelings, tourists' knowledge of the ecological environment is also enhanced, eventually leading to a more environmentally responsible behavior.\n",
      "Moeller, Dolnicar, and Leisch's  study on eco-travelers showed that the higher the travel expenditures the stronger the environmental awareness.\n",
      "Thus, activity involvement can be used to understand tourists' perceptions about travel activities and predict environmentally responsible behavior.\n",
      "The Chinese version of the questionnaire was then sent to local travel operators for a critical review and feedback.\n",
      "3.2 Sample design and data collection In order to effectively measure the perceived value of tourists, this study chose a travel destination that requires an admission fee, the Sicao Ecological Area in Taijiang National Park.\n",
      "Tourists in the context of eco-travel should be responsive to environmentally responsible insights.\n",
      "Hence, the sample informants can be considered to be ecotravelers and therefore qualify as questionnaire respondents.\n",
      "This shows that the perceived value of eco-travel activity positively influences environmentally responsible behavior directly, while satisfaction and activity involvement can additionally strengthen environmentally responsible behavior.\n",
      "5 Discussion and conclusions This study set up a model based on the value-attitude-behavior theory to explain the formation of environmentally responsible behavior via tourists' perceived value, activity involvement and satisfaction with respect to the eco-travel experience.\n",
      "Unlike past studies that explore environmentally responsible behavior as a generic trait, the results of this study suggest that environmentally responsible behavior unfolds during and after the delivery of the travel experience.\n",
      "Higher perceived value of the eco-travel experience enhances environmentally responsible behavior; in addition, satisfaction and activity involvement can promote environmentally responsible behavior at ecological sites, lowering the damage to the environment.\n",
      "This study sees activity involvement as the mediating variable to link perceived value and environmentally responsible behavior, confirming that tourist involvement tends to be influenced by perceived value of the travel site.\n",
      "Here, satisfaction about the eco-travel experience refers not only to travel attributes but also includes affection as an important dimension.\n",
      "The framework shows different pathways through which environmentally responsible behavior can be established and advanced during and as a result of the eco-travel experience.\n",
      "Tourists travel in ecological spots because they are attracted by nature.\n",
      "6 Management implications Ecotourism is a form of travel that is based on the enjoyment of natural resources while at the same time minimizing the adverse impact of travel activities on the travel sites.\n",
      "With perceived value a key determinant, managerial attention must focus on the tangible and intangible benefits that are to be provided to the traveler.\n",
      "The design of ecotourism packages needs to build on tourist needs and offer comprehensive services and facilities on the basis of which the ecotourist can evaluate the travel package.\n",
      "Although ecotourism is an obvious trend in the travel industry by far not all tourists possess a high degree of consciousness with regard to environmental protection; in accordance with the findings of this study, it is advisable for decision-makers to focus in a first step on the creation and delivery of value in ecotourism.\n",
      "The framework could be tested in different types of eco-travel settings, for example in forest areas, natural conservation areas, at wildlife sites or whale-watching tours.\n",
      "Future research could also explore what kind of impact the frequency of eco-travels and the resulting familiarity with ecotourism would have on traveler's environmentally responsible behavior.\n",

      "Cases where film tourism effects have been observed now proliferate, and examples range across the spectrum of genres, from: blockbusters and ‘must-see’ films like Braveheart , Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings  ; romantic films like Notting Hill ; heritage and costume film and TV dramas , such as Pride and Prejudice , Sense and Sensibility and Downton Abbey; continuing dramas, or ‘soaps’, such as Winter Sonata  and Sea Change ; more cult offerings like Monty Python  and Twilight; through to thrillers such as Motor Cycle Diaries ; travel-gastronomy style shows such as those presented by Rick Stein, and; even children's programmes such as Balamory .\n",
      "However, film tourism is not solely a demand-side perspective and the development of film tourism from a supply perspective has emerged as a strand within the literature noting that a substantial industry has developed around the opportunities presented by film as a travel-inducing agent.\n",
      "In one of the seminal reviews of the field, Pocock  argues that literature, like film, has both the power to stimulate tourist travel, and to create tourist expectations of a destination.\n",
      "The impact of a number of TV dramas  on a viewer's propensity to travel to filming sites, and the experiences of film tourists at such sites, has formed a substantive area of study for film tourism research, particularly from 2006.\n",
      "Moreover, Jewell and McKinnon  argue that film tourism creates new cultural landscapes, not simply just generating a desire to travel but forming part of place identity.\n",
      "As de Certeau  argues in the case of literature, and perhaps which is more acutely applicable to the moving image, “readers are travellers: they move across lands belonging to someone else, like nomads, poaching their way across field they did not write…”.\n",
      "Avid viewers search out exact locations, the process of which is facilitated by books and web sites , or form mental images that might stimulate travel to a destination .\n",
      "5.3.2.1 Vicarious consumption of space and place Some places have become familiar within the imagination of those who have never travelled there through the medium of film and television.\n",
      "Hitchcock notably used locations for promotional appeal to take audiences to attractive faraway places, which suggests the importance of the travelogue function in the early days of commercial cinema and the emphasis on glamorous locations, particularly given improved mobility for the increasingly affluent middle classes, an audience eager to escape to alluring places.\n",
      "Such media representations allow people to travel to destinations through their own imaginations and as a consequence, real places and spaces take on fantasy-like attributes through a process of mediatisation, creating “imaginative geographies”  and “fantasy geographies” .\n",
      "However, research more broadly shows that film locations attract a wide range of tourists, and given that most film tourism studies tend to focus on a particular production that may be appealing to a particular demographic, then the results of such studies may not be transferable to other film locations )  are very different from Balamory visitors  , while female audiences display a higher propensity to travel to Korean soap opera filming locations .\n",
      "Although there have been several empirical studies on the role of film in changing or shaping destination image as noted above, the majority of studies are relatively small-scale and have produced results that require further validation before more general conclusions can be made with regard to how film affects perceptions of destinations, and to what extent such perceptions create or influence a travel decision.\n",
      "Iwashita  in a study of Japanese tourism to the UK found that films and television programmes featuring the UK formed the most significant source in increasing interest to travel, compared with travel guides, travel literature and marketing promotions.\n",
      "In the 1930s, there is no real evidence of film stimulating a desire to visit a location although Brégent-Heald  suggests that cross-border travel was quite high at the time of the film despite the effects of the Depression.\n",
      "A significant number of consultancy reports present the case for film tourism as a major motivator for tourist travel on a national scale, and DMOs and Tourist Boards have been quick to pick up this opportunity.\n",
      "Above all, film tourism requires the development of rigorous methodologies that are able to generate valid results in terms of measuring the extent of film tourism demand, and the degree to which tourists are stimulated to travel as a result of film.\n",

      "Nevertheless, regarding applying big data to tourism research, to the best of our knowledge, there existed only three relevant reviews: Rashidi, Abbasi, Maghrebi, Hasan, and Waller  explored the capacity of social media data for modelling travel movements; Schuckert, Liu, and Law  reviewed the studies on online reviews in tourism and hospitality; Shoval and Ahas  conducted a literature review on tracking data in tourism research.\n",
      "3 UGC data In the digital age, the boom in web and social media has dramatically changed the way of traveling, providing a spacious platform to share UGC data.\n",
      "3.1 Online textual data Social media, thriving on the vigorous development of Internet, offers an ample platform for tourists to spread a variety of tourism-related information, such as traveling reviews and experiences.\n",
      "For example, travelers can express their satisfaction and dissatisfaction toward tourism products, generating a rich mine of online reviews data.\n",
      "Tourists can also share their traveling perspectives and experiences in blogs such as Twitter and Sina Weibo, providing valuable information for potential tourists.\n",
      "The main reason for the popularity of these three reviewed targets might be that lodging, eating and traveling might be the top three important factors that travelers are mostly concerned about in a tour.\n",
      "Blogs data, recording travelling stories and tourist feelings, mainly addressed tourism recommendation and tourist sentiment analysis.\n",
      "For tourism recommendation, Yuan, Xu, Qian, and Li  used tourist blogs data to mine tourism locations and travel sequences for an efficient travel schedule.\n",
      "Sina Weibo, the Chinese alternative to Twitter, was also employed by Cheng and Edwards  to explore potential tourist generating regions, the life span of travel news, and tourists’ attitudes toward travel policy changes.\n",
      "●  Tokenization, with the aim to break up the travel-related textual data into words, phrases or other meaningful elements, namely tokens.\n",
      "Through this process, the tourism-related keywords regarding tourism spots, travel feelings, etc.\n",
      "For example, recent studies trended to use sentiment analysis as a useful tool for investigating travelers' opinions toward hotel services  and hot locations .\n",
      "Marine-Roig and Clavé  employed categorization to group the hidden information in travel blogs and reviews on Barcelona into meaningful categories according to keywords.\n",
      "●  Dependency modeling, for capturing the relationship between textual data  and tourism factors like hotel performance , restaurant performance  and traveler behaviors .\n",
      "Moreover, other interesting issues regarding the travel-related online textual data can be also considered, such as data reliability.\n",
      "However, the travelers from a different cultural background seek a different travel benefit and have a different preference .\n",
      "Exploring travel recommendations from photo data, regarding tourism destinations, travel routes and tourism duration, has been sufficiently studied.\n",
      "To find effective travel routes , diverse travel route recommendation systems were proposed with the aim at extracting travel paths from a mass of photos .\n",
      "Second, a clustering analysis was conducted on the extracted metadata from three primary perspectives: spatial dimension for discovering tourism spots ; user dimension for travelers’ origins ; temporal dimension for tourism durations .\n",
      "Finally, travel trajectories, , the sequence of tourism spots and the time intervals between them, are investigated for making appropriate travel plans.\n",
      "Furthermore, Markov chain technique, a probabilistic model well handling sequential information, was another promising algorithm to capture more detailed knowledge of travel routes and to predict the next tourism spots based on tourists' current locations .\n",
      "Through this step, travel trajectories can be extracted from massive travelers’ movements .\n",
      "Through the above three steps, a powerful tourism recommendation system can be formulated not only to extract valuable information from online photos regarding tourist behavior, tourism spots, tourism durations and travel trajectories, but also to present useful recommendations for travelling— where to travel, how to travel and how long to travel.\n",
      "However, temporal patterns, such as the best visiting time and duration, are also important factors in making appropriate travel plans.\n",
      "Moreover, automatic weather station sensors have collected a rich mine of meteorological data to serve travel decision making, given that weather is an important factor in tourism.\n",
      "As a tool for tracking travelers’ special movements, the distinctive advantage of GPS lies in being both global and accurate.\n",
      "Representative examples were: descriptive analysis, to estimate average travel time  and GPS data points as well as their precision ; circular statistics, to compute circular mean times and dispersions for different groups of tourists .\n",
      "For instances, when transforming GPS data into graphs, powerful graph mining methods could be introduced, for instance, to identify tourism areas and travel routes .\n",
      "Since travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, travelers trend to use their mobile phones in other place or even foreign countries inevitably.\n",
      "On the other hand, roaming data have been applied to analyzing tourist behavior such as tourist flows , travel distances , repeat visiting , destination loyalty  and space consumption .\n",
      "In particular, GPS data can trace spatial movements continuously during the whole travel, whereas mobile roaming data record the locations only on active uses of mobile phones in the mobile network: outgoing and incoming calls; sending and receiving messages; using the Internet and data services .\n",
      "constructed a linear regression to evaluate travel distance.\n",
      "Recently, Guo  used meteorological big data to calculate tourism indexes of tourism industry and provide tourism recommendations to travelers, via the Hadoop architecture and MapReduce algorithm.\n",
      "However, the value of meteorological data might be underestimated, given that a satisfactory travel is high in relation to a fine weather.\n",
      "For example, mining meteorological data will offer useful insights into various tourism decisions, such as traveling plan making and tourism product design.\n",
      "In particular, tourists can seek travel information through a search engine, leaving searching traces on the websites; in return, such traces are recorded and processed to form a valuable type of big data—web search data, directly reflecting public attention toward a tourism item thereby helpfully understanding tourism market.\n",
      "In addition, web search data have also been proved useful in SEO or search engine marketing —a promising measure for travel and tourism  marketing.\n",
      "Web search data, reflecting travelers’ searching behavior on the Internet, obviously have a great relationship with SEO and SEM.\n",
      "For example, Xiang & Pan  identified the patterns in online travel queries across tourist destinations, and offered insightful implications to SEM for tourist destinations.\n",

      "For example, tourism agencies have been involved in the World Expo planning since its early stages: already in 2008, the Shanghai municipality delegated to a series of travel agents the preparation of tourism itineraries for international visitors to the World Expo who wished to visit China.\n",
      "This meant, of course, that there was a continuous dialogue between the Government, the authorised travel agencies and the hotel owners’ associations.\n",
      "As the people interviewed reported, there was a significant decentralisation of the decision-making process, because the travel agencies had an unprecedented level of autonomy when selecting the hotels and choosing the content of the tourist packages to be offered to international visitors.\n",

      "That is, he defines thanatourism as ‘… travel to a location wholly, or partially, motivated by the desire for actual or symbolic encounters with death, particularly, but not exclusively, violent death, which may, to a varying degree be activated by the person-specific features of those whose deaths are its focal objects’ .\n",

      "1 The tourism sector “relates to the activity of travellers on trips outside their usual environment with a duration of less than one year” .\n",
      "The explanation for these figures is not trivial, as tourism flows are determined by various factors such as overall tourism facilities, attractions, amenities, climate, proximity to wealthy and populated markets, origin and destination prices, travel costs, and accessibility .\n",
      "More generally, the choice among destinations includes a comparison of the utility coming from the visit with the overall costs of the stay,  including travel costs.\n",
      "In this respect, the presence of non-stop flights for international destinations reduces the generalized cost of travel and makes the visit to the destination more appealing .\n",
      "The negative effect of distance is explained by its positive correlation with the generalized cost of travel, which is softened by the presence of non-stop flights .\n",
      "A key role in the choice of the tourism destination is also played by the overall cost of the holiday: the generalized cost of travel and the expenditures for goods and services at the destination .\n",
      "In some cases travel costs represent the largest item in the expenses of the holiday, and therefore may be a very relevant driver in the choice of the destination.\n",
      "The cost of travel also affects tourism demand for short-haul destinations: for instance, Garin-Munoz  finds that the cheap fares offered by LCCs have spurred German tourism to Spain.\n",
      "Airlines and tourism The link between airline supply and international tourism is tied to the travel costs, which are an important component of the destination choice.\n",
      "Since many travelers are price sensitive, the cheap air fares offered by LCCs spur the movement of leisure travelers .\n",
      "Indeed, it may happen that for leisure or for family celebrations migrants return to their native country, or friends and relatives travel to the migrants’ country of residence.\n",
      "From Googlemaps we retrieved the region-country distance, expressed in thousands of kilometers and defined as the shortest travel path by car between the capitals of each pair.\n",
      "The railway variables aim to measure the development of the infrastructure in the country of origin and in the region of destination: we expect a better infrastructure to be a facilitator of travel and hence of tourism flows.\n",
      "Moreover, Distance can partially account for the travel cost; however under a panel framework the explanatory power of Distance may be limited by the time-invariant feature of the variable, which ignores the changes in market conditions that may occur over time .\n",
      "First, the choice of tourism destination is based on many sources, such as word-of-mouth, travel agents, published catalogues, and specialized journals.\n",
      "8 An airport catchment area in Europe is, at most, two hours road travel time to the airport .\n",
      "Even though we have no evidence on previous LCC travel behavior, we reckon that the habit of staying in flats or rooms not included in the hotel statistics may also occur in the sample period of our analysis.\n",
      "Indeed, airlines, and LCCs in particular, have a primary role in the attraction of tourism flows; travel savings due to cheaper fares are partially transferred to higher expenditures at destinations .\n",
      "Third, our data do not include charter traffic, which mainly channels leisure travelers.\n",
      "Moreover, additional analysis is required to study the impact of airline supply on the duration of the stay, for instance, to test Ferrer-Rosell, Martínez-Garcia, and Coenders  findings that tourists traveling with LCCs stay slightly longer than tourists traveling with FSCs.\n",

      "Tour operators explicitly identified public security as a concern and a potential major constraint to travel to Ethiopia.\n",
      "The competitiveness is also affected by inconvenience and inaccessibility to travel to and get around in Ethiopia, which is a significant challenge for senior Japanese travellers.\n",
      "However, the perceived unfriendly image of Ethiopia by tourists, such as safety concerns, were key constraints identified by destination marketers to convince potential visitors to travel to Ethiopia.\n",

      "A lower percentage of those who travel on their own engaged with social media.\n",
      "A chief implication for travel and hospitality managers is that, in fact, people from different countries have diverse reasons for posting, and the hospitality industry must take into account these differences in posting behaviours .\n",
      "Despite the growing enthusiasm about social media, empirical research findings suggest that the majority of Internet users are not using UGC for travel planning.\n",

      "Therefore, the main outcome of the Madrid case study is that tourists are willing to revisit the city regardless of the presence of HSR, due to the high percentage of tourists in the sample travelling from countries far away from Spain.\n",
      "The main reason to do that  was the shorter travel time offered by HSR .\n",
      "Based on the results of the survey about the motivation for revisiting other cities nearby Madrid, we designed a second model  aimed at identifying the variables which have an impact on the use of HSR to travel, for tourism purposes, from Madrid to nearby cities linked by HSR, such as Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, Cordova, etc.\n",
      "The probability to reach two near cities by AVE , the accessibility of the departure/arrival station , travel comfort , service frequency  and safety  have a positive impact on the probability to use HSR services to visit other cities located near Madrid.\n",
      "The third conclusion is that HSR shows great attractiveness for foreign tourists, as they generally value aspects such as comfort and travel time reductions, and are generally less sensitive to ticket prices.\n",

      "Emissions from tourism-related transport can be determined by multiplying travel distances with the emission factors.\n",
      "3.2 Green transport and sustainable mobility Sustainable tourism is tightly connected with the concept of sustainable mobility since tourism is always linked to travel such as air transport and buses.\n",
      "The amount of emissions from international transport depends on travel mode, fuel efficiency, international business, emission offset initiatives, and externalities for carbon footprint of global tourism.\n",
      "Green practices of transportation can revolve around efficient use of resources or modification of the transport structure to provide more sustainable travel choices.\n",
      "For airline liberalization, it can promote public investments in improving the infrastructure and efficiency of air travel, such as airspace and air-traffic management , which can obtain significant benefits.\n",
      "In the case of PMC, however, tourism industry could gain or lose from the increase in passengers' tax, since it depends on three major factors :  the price elasticity for travel demands,  the balance between inbound and outbound travels, and  the extent to which domestic tourism is a substitute for international tourism.\n",
      "The convergence between tourism travel and information/communication constitutes a key feature of a mobile society .\n",

      "To identify the cultural tourist types outlined above, the analysis of one or two travel motives would not be sufficient.\n",

      "Since the linear correlation between both constructs does not reveal strong differences, the travel motive  likely acts as a moderator on the Cultural Contact Scale impacting in a non-linear manner.\n",
      "Since only 16% of the respondents can be classified into a group of travelers for whom Maori culture appeared among the top three travel motives, the vast majority would not be recognized as a typical cultural tourist.\n",

      "Given the quantity and quality of existing research and the subsequent findings of this study, a theoretical framework emerges that explains the convergence of the agenda-setting power of the media and the formation of risk perception in the potential traveler exposed to the media coverage of a serious crime against a tourist.\n",
      "As previously noted, fear on the part of news consumer and ultimately, the potential traveler, is fostered by the media's depiction of the real or imagined inability of a destination to protect its guests.\n",
      "Though news consumers may be regularly exposed to crime and accidents, the prevalence of stories involving the murder or violent crime of an international traveler or fellow countryman, in this case, Natalee Holloway, because she was a teenager, may have aroused their emotions to a different level.\n",

      "When the media, news consumer and potential travelers are examined as part of an interdependent social framework that engages in repeated analyses of stimuli, the examination of specific frames for a shift in attitude or decision on the part of the consumer might provide clues for law enforcement officials and destination marketers seeking image recovery from a widely publicized crime against a foreign tourist.\n",

      "With respect to the first regard, rapidly rising and persistent demand for domestic and international travel is a strong contributor to carbon emissions.\n",
      "In addition to a volume increase, travel behavior is showing fundamental changes, with travelers looking to travel farther, for shorter stays, and with greater reliance on aviation .\n",

      "Particularly, travel behaviors in transportation mode shifting and the market mix selection provide feasible mitigation strategies .\n",
      "4.2 Limitation of this framework In terms of limitations, this framework suffers from missing linkages between travel behaviors and monetary consumption.\n",
      "For example, critical social and behavioral factors, such as propensity to travel, population growth, disposable income growth, travel distance, length of stay, or transportation mode switching , are not endogenously incorporated.\n",
      "This also suggests future research to address the dynamics between activity-based travel volume, monetary consumption and subsequent industry energy use patterns.\n",
      "We believe the following factors are the critical causes: reliance on aviation for a strong international travel demand; slow efficiency improvement among transportation sectors; and a lack of obvious management options for tourism emissions.\n",
      "Regarding the first factor, the “modal shifting” strategy proposed by the UNWTO for short-haul travel and transportation mode changes is especially challenging for island destinations because international aviation cannot be easily substituted and will remain a major contributor to the overall tourism CF.\n",
      "The global trends for growing tourism demand, increasing long-haul travel, and more frequent holidays  are also observed in Taiwan, and simultaneously increase the burden of energy use by the transportation sector.\n",

      "The difference between the impact score of the car and the plane, which can be somehow surprising if we consider the travel of a single passenger, can be explained by the fact that air travel has a higher efficiency in terms of the number of passengers per flight, whilst the cars travel often with only one or two passengers.\n",

      "  1 Introduction Gastronomic tourism is a growing trend in travel, because food experience is a path to discovering the local culture and traditions of a destination .\n",
      "Recently, research in destination branding has focused more explicitly on food image as a core tourism product in its own right, and as an intangible cultural heritage of a destination, particularly for tourists who purposely travel to a given destination because of its food image .\n",
      "In order to evaluate the food attributes used in Australia's destination branding, Tourism Australia's official website, travel brochures, food and wine campaign factsheets, and historical books were reviewed to identify the presence of the 40 proposed image attributes.\n",
      "Given that the primary purpose of the research was to investigate the image perceived by industry stakeholders, our target participants were tourism, travel and hospitality industry practitioners around Australia who were directly or indirectly involved in planning, promoting and implementing the Australian food and wine campaign.\n",
      "Of the 18 respondents, 17 are industry practitioners, including destination marketers, chefs, celebrity chefs, food and beverage providers, consultants, a project manager of a food and wine tourism strategy, a filmmaker of Australian food traveller programme, and a media agent of Tourism Australia, and one is an academic researcher who is involved in consultancy work within Australia's restaurant industry .\n",

      "In fact, residents of a tourism destination and travellers can interact with each other in online communities, and “the interaction occurs before the traveller arrives at the destination and may influence where travellers visit and their choice of accommodation and restaurants” .\n",

      "Leiper  explains that destinations are places towards which people travel and where they choose to stay for a while in order to experience certain features or characteristics-a perceived attraction of some sort.\n",
      "Middleton and Hawkins  state that “a marketing perspective is essentially an overall management orientation reflecting corporate attitudes that, in the case of travel and tourism, must balance the interests of shareholders/owners with the long-run environmental interests of a destination and at the same time meet the demands and expectations of customers”.\n",
      "Each destination can only match certain types of demand and hence tourism marketers need to appreciate travel motivations in order to develop appropriate offerings and brand destinations for the right target markets.\n",
      "These criteria are altered according to the purpose and features of the trip, elements of the external environment, the characteristics of the traveller and the particularities and attributes of destinations.\n",

      "Business trips are fairly inflexible and it is often difficult for travellers to select their destinations.\n",
      "Business travel, often referred to as meetings–incentives–conferences–exhibitions , is normally determined by business opportunities and involvement of the traveller with organisations at the destination.\n",
      "Perhaps, more flexibility can be exercised by travelers attending optional meetings, which provide benefits but are not strictly essential to their business such as conferences, exhibitions, incentives, familiarisation trips, etc.\n",
      "Even though business tourism is much more restricted in terms of choice, destinations providing a high-degree of efficiency and safety, as well as elegance and leisure opportunities tend to be preferred for conferences and incentive travel.\n",
      "Business travel is seasonal, as people do not generally travel less during the holiday seasons, , summer months and public holidays.\n",
      "The location of meeting partners, host organisations, as well as company policy may determine the selection of destinations for business travel.\n",
      "Leisure travellers, on the other hand, use a much more complex set of criteria in selecting their destination.\n",
      "In addition, leisure travellers are often time sensitive as families with children cannot travel during school time, creating the seasonality problem for the industry.\n",
      "For example, pensioners and elderly people tend to travel during the low season to benefit from discounts, whilst Scandinavian tourists tend to stay home during the summer months in order to enjoy the whether.\n",

      "On the other hand, leisure travellers can take advantage of some of the unique facilities and services of urban destinations to enjoy short-breaks or extended weekends.\n",
      "Typically, European leisure travellers will take their annual holiday at Mediterranean seaside resorts, whilst Northern Americans visit Southern regions such as Florida, California and the Caribbean.\n",

      "Examples include destinations such as Goa and Bali which take advantage of developments in transportation and attract travellers.\n",

      "Lakes and scenic landscapes make alpine resorts increasingly more popular for conference and incentive tourists and thus a certain business travelling activity can be observed in the last few years.\n",
      "Farmers and rural populations take advantage of the desire of travellers to go back to nature and experience some authentic agricultural processes.\n",
      "These destinations focus on the non-charter and non-mass traveller reducing their visitation but maximising their income per visitor.\n",
      "They often epitomise the dream of the average traveller and thus are packaged and priced as prestigious special products, for instance for weddings, honeymoons, anniversaries or a special occasion trip, or for incentive travel.\n",
      "Data is often collected by frontier controls, airports and transport authorities, national statistics offices, local councils, tax offices as well as principals such as hotels, travel agencies, etc.\n",
      "Thus, travellers base their decision to visit the area merely on price, while the demand for the destination is incidental and destinations are unable to attract high spenders.\n",
      "The ubiquity of the destination concept effectively means that the tourism product for each prospective traveller is very subjective and depends heavily on his/her image and expectations of the place.\n",
      "In most cases they have not visited the destination before they purchase their travel product.\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest travel expenditure is transport to and from the destination, especially for long haul trips, and thus can determine the willingness and ability of travellers to visit destinations.\n",
      "However, increasingly consumers are unimpressed by tourism facilities and products, as they have travelled extensively and have acquired a wealth of experiences.\n",
      "Business travellers have strict schedules and use intermediaries to organise their itineraries.\n",
      "In contrast, leisure travellers tend to have much greater flexibility and price elasticity.\n",
      "Business travellers can be influenced indirectly by people who are responsible for arranging business meetings and conferences.\n",
      "These include corporate travel officers and administrative staff in organisations who choose the location of meetings, as well as services suppliers.\n",
      "For destinations to attract business travellers they need to develop strong links with the local business and academic communities as well as with various types of associations.\n",
      "This will enable DMOs to appreciate the needs of business travellers and to provide convenient and adequate products.\n",
      "Consequently, relationships with business travel agencies as well as conference and exhibition organisers are important to attract and satisfy the MICE markets.\n",
      "Leisure travellers have a much wider choice and flexibility and therefore a different distribution strategy and mix are required.\n",
      "Domestic tourists usually make direct arrangements and often use their own transport, whereas international leisure travellers tend to be more influenced by intermediaries.\n",
      "Leisure travellers often require travel agencies advice on selecting appropriate destinations and products.\n",
      "Hence, destinations need to provide travel agencies with information and promotional material, as well as to organise educational trips and provide incentives for their staff in order to promote the destination to consumers.\n",
      "Developing long-term partnerships with tour operators and leisure travel agencies is therefore extremely significant for the success of leisure destinations.\n",

      "  1 Introduction First, the section describes an interesting topic in research background and research problem, research motivation, and research objective to bridge the gap of the tourism research to lesson the travelers’ motivating behavior for a proposed work with noted concerns.\n",
      "The great benefits of travel are relaxing, increasing our knowledge, and widening our perspective.\n",
      "However, the tourism industry faces new problems from the increase in visits, and international tourism continues to grow with significant opportunities and areas for contribution ahead for travel services, which may amplify challenges to travel for the future.\n",
      "Notably, it attracts the attention of countries’ governments and tourism firms worldwide to develop a growing number ‎of new travel destinations or special themes and celebrities to attract international travelers.\n",
      "In particular, it is interesting and important to explore aspects of this dynamic and positive nature, such as travel motivation [4–6], among travelers.\n",
      "Thus, the related issues and importance for the exploration of travel motivation in the tourism industry are concerned in this study.\n",
      "The travel motivation elucidates the features that influence a tourist to take tourism [7,8].\n",
      "According to the well-known original research of Crompton [9], motivation is considered as the impelling/compelling force of a critical factor just to explain all tourist behaviors, such as “What makes tourist travel” for ego-enhancement and self-recognition drives, to reveal socio-psychological characteristics of individuals, and to identify specific behavior features.\n",
      "For example, the travel on vacation can separate an individual from the repressed feeling in real life every day and have positive consequences for human behavior and social interaction.\n",
      "Hence, travel motivations for forming a relationship with travel behavior of travelers have been extensively researched and applied in various domains, such as tourism marketing plans.\n",
      "From a growing phenomenon on prevalent trends/issues of investigating traveler responses through past studies, the noted push/pull factors have been more widely used to highlight the relationship between travel motivations and tourist behavior [10,11].\n",
      "On one hand, the push factors firstly explaining a traveler to travel are the socio-psychological needs for ego-enhancement drive [12]; on the other hand, the pull factors significantly make the motivations to lastly drive a specific destination [10].\n",
      "Furthermore, the empirical results in Van Vuuren and Slabbert [13] described that the core travel motivations include relaxing action, enriching and learning experiences, participation in recreational activities, personal values, and social experiences.\n",
      "On the contrary, regarding the travel destination of pull factors, Papatheodorou [14] stated that various factors influence travel decisions for destination choice, including culture, travel motivations, finances, and earlier experiences.\n",
      "The needs to mining out the known/unknown drives to travelers to travel new places and destinations [15] are encouraged to study in the future.\n",
      "Although these open issues of travel behavior had been further studied from numerous researchers in the past decades in order to identify the core tourist motivations and destinations for the push/pull formation [16] with a satisfactory response from a view of finding an alternative in the restricted knowledge, they are still required to be addressed for the emerged problems from the tourism issues.\n",
      "However, it is found that few researches are conducted to process the travel behavior of travelers and lack of related information when connecting Taiwan resort topics.\n",
      "The emerged problems include how to understand the travel motivation for Taiwan’ travelers and benefit the ruling tourism strategy of attracting travelers for interested parties, such as travel managers, travel agencies, public authorities, and online travel companies, which are thus regarded as a main research problem in this study since the knowledge from understanding travelers’ motivating behavior can further increase their tourism strategic development and planning or arrange travel itinerary, such as tourist scenery.\n",
      "For the reasons noted above, this study aims to present the cause-effect motivations of travelers behind travel behavior and identifies accurate and suitable triggers to enrich research results from sustainable development and continuous competition in the tourism sector in Taiwan.\n",
      "Therefore, the growing knowledge of travel motivations in other research works has prompted and foregrounded this study for providing and filling the gap of solving the problems faced by Taiwan’s recreation industry.\n",
      "1.2 Research motivation People pay attention to quality of life, are willing to take trips in their spare time, and consider travel an irreplaceable leisure; in considering the applications of travel services, it is crucial for the tourism industry to define the related factors in travel motivation among tourists from the perspective of personal values.\n",
      "The reasons for travel come from one’s inner motivations; perhaps travel motivations are based on one’s first expectations and may influence the outcome of a holiday.\n",
      "There are theories and models [17] developed for studying travel motivation from various angles, such as psychology, social psychology, and anthropology.\n",
      "Prayag [19] also used the push and pull framework to understand the motives of senior travelers and their future behavioral intentions, and he indicated that rest and relaxation, spending time with family, and being together as a family are the three most important motives for visiting cities.\n",
      "They found that significant relationships between the nine typologies, tourist spending, travel style and length of stay.\n",
      "Their findings provide valuable help for other researchers seeking to conduct further research using PVQ [23] that can be used to travel-related work.\n",
      "In particular, based on the literature [24], the laddering interview technique, usually a one-on-one, tape-recorded, and semi-structured interview embedded in MEC theory, provides respondents more freedom of expression and is typified by the question “Why is this important to you?” to understand the traveler’s decisions.\n",
      "Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that MEC theory [17] is suitable for a wide range of applications, such as benefit-based analysis of consumer goals and customer expectations and analysis of consumer perceptions of various products or services, such as travel.\n",
      "Thus, the above techniques and methods attract this study’s attention to explore and understand travelers’ motivations and rationalize the information of technical background and theoretical research for the study.\n",
      "The rationale for the use of ISM in activities such as travel-based applications is developed in the basic principles and concepts underlying the techniques explored.\n",
      "The rapid advancements in the tourism sector have not only provided entertainment to consumers but also acceleratedly triggered travelers’ motivation to travel.\n",
      "Given the reasons mentioned-above, the integrating method of hybrid “PVQ+MEC+ISM” model with the A-C-V chain for exploring travel motivation is serious lack on the limited information from the literature review.\n",
      "Thus, this study attempts to examine the structure of the A-C-V chain of travel motivation based on the theoretical framework of the hybrid “PVQ+MEC+ISM” model with the soft laddering interview technique from a limited review of related researches or techniques that are rarely studied in a relatively under-used method in tourism industry applications.\n",
      "This research gap should be bridged from technical application views, and this study only uses the supplementary materials for the following three selection reasons:  Given the research motivation, this study employs PVQ to identify two corresponding groups of A-C-V chains and uses the laddering interview technique to conduct MEC;  this study uses an expert questionnaire to build ISM; and  the MEC method analyzes the difference between the two corresponding groups in terms of the influence of personal values on travel motivations.\n",
      "The research objectives have the following four directions based on the related research background and motivation in this study:  Construct a suitable model to explore the factors motivating people to travel in the tourism sector of Taiwan;  use PVQ to examine whether different personalities affect people’s travel motivations;  use the MEC and ISM methods to identify differences between the two corresponding groups; and  provide interested parties with sufficient results to generate more good ideas for promotions and decision-making.\n",
      "Section 2 reviews the related work of travelers’ motivations.\n",
      "2 Related work The related work accordingly addresses related issues on travel motivation for people, which include travel motivation and its past applications, the quasi-circumplex structure of personal values and the portrait value questionnaire method, the means-end-chain with the laddering interview technique, and the interpretive structural modeling method.\n",
      "2.1 Travel motivation and its past applications Exploring factors that influence related motivations of consumers  from viewpoints noted by earlier studies is interesting and important, particularly regarding the topic of travel motivations [29,30].\n",
      "On the one hand, the push factors are socio-psychological motivations, explaining the desire to take a vacation; on the other hand, the pull factors are motives induced by the destination rather than emerging exclusively from the traveler and have been thought useful for explaining the choice of destination Collier [32] raised the point of view from the demand side; he stated that the factors of travel demand have often been analyzed as two sets: First, travel facilitators that enable a person to travel, and second, travel motivators that help explain why people willing to travel actually choose to do so.\n",
      "Chen and Wu [35] investigated the influences of travel motivations, travel constraints, and demographic variables for the purpose of identifying the significant predictors of seniors’ overseas travel intentions.\n",
      "Ahn and Janke [38] examined the motivations and benefits of educational travel among individuals aged 55 years old and over.\n",
      "[40] explored features including socio-demographic profile, travel behavior, benefits obtained, satisfaction, and loyalty to present a market segmentation of a Portuguese social tourism program for seniors.\n",
      "[43] investigated elderly tourists’ motivation to examine the relationship among motivation, constraints, leisure-life domain satisfaction, and overall life satisfaction related to traveler behaviors.\n",
      "[45] explored the mediating role of social media between the motivation factors and the travel decision for visually impaired tourists and found that relaxation, self-exploration, and accessibility were the significant factors that contribute to travel decisions.\n",
      "Han and Hyun [46] measured that the relationship between cruise travel motivations and satisfaction to identify the impact of such association on traveler loyalty by applying the moderating effect of traveler involvement.\n",
      "Table 1  lists the factors and definitions of related consumer motivations regarding travel topics according to the above-described researches in the latest two-decade in chronological sequence.\n",
      "Thus, the two main dimensions of Openness to change and Conservation are focused and used to measure personal values using PVQ in this study due to their practical utility in measuring travel motivation.\n",
      "[64] applied MEC and hard laddering method to examine the hierarchical relationship between pilgrimage attributes and the fulfillment of personal values exhibited by travelers, and the strongest associations were found between attributes, consequences, and values.\n",
      "Based on the above success in the related literature, the MEC with a laddering interview to create a HVM will be used as qualitative tools to distinguish attributes of travel motivation and explore the effect of these attributes in defining A-C-V structure.\n",
      "3 Research design and method This section introduces the emerged issues, including the research concept, participants and questionnaire design, and proposed hybrid procedure, of travel motivation for personal values to define the main research problem for the technical and managerial gaps in the study.\n",
      "3.1 Research concept For the tourism industry, it is important to recognize and identify the factors that motivate tourists in Taiwan to motivate consumers to traveler from the perspective of travelers’ personal values and provide completely customized service.\n",
      "To discuss the travel motivation of different people, this study enlists the help of useful techniques.\n",
      "Thus, this study aims to investigate the connections between travel motivation factors and personal values to minimize this gap and explore their deeper relationship.\n",
      "Second, this study uses MEC with the soft laddering interview technique on a one-to-one basis to create a HVM so that travel-related organizations may further understand what motivation will affect the travelers’ decisions; this technique is typified by the questions “Why is this important to you?” and “Where and what type of holiday?” Third, based on the elements of the generated HVM, this study further seeks expert opinions to complete the SSIM to accordingly build the moderation of expert ISM.\n",
      "One is the participants who had extensive  experience in the field of travel and were involved in the processes from the questionnaire phase to the interview phase by taking part in an online or face-to-face interview.\n",
      "The participants are invited to complete a PVQ that is designed to acquire their personality and travel motivation to obtain the most intuitionistic results at the beginning of the interview session.\n",
      "This study thus proposes a hybrid procedure using three main procedures:  The laddering interview technique to construct three HVMs for different personal values,  a three-expert ISM to develop the final reachability matrix to build an ISM, and  a hierarchical model to build the related travel motivations as well as comparison analysis.\n",
      "Soft laddering interview technique The participants in the interview phase answer “what is the reason that motivates you to travel?” and “How can travel help you?” Then, they also must answer “Why is a beautiful view important to you?”  and “Why is the particular consequence  important to you?” The interviews then lead to a consequence .\n",
      "Once the participants cannot provide more reasons, or are not willing to answer, the interview process of searching for factors in travel is stopped; simultaneously, this respondent questionnaire will be dropped since it is recognized as an invalid sample.\n",
      "Draw the ISM diagram: Finally, based on the relationships given in the reachability matrix and the results of different levels in different iterations, plot the ISM diagram with different levels and information associated with the factors, and make some difference analysis for this diagram structure of the related travel motivations from viewpoint of the A-C-V chain.\n",
      "C. Third procedure: Hierarchical model  Finally, the hierarchical model builds the related travel motivations based on the above experimental results and make a comparison analysis for the conclusive view and evidence.\n",
      "4 Building the hierarchical model and assessing the empirical results This section mainly illustrates the process of building the MEC hierarchical model and ISM in travel motivation and conducts the consequential contents that include data analysis of the questionnaire, results of MEC, results of ISM, empirical results, findings/significance and contribution of the study, and discussion and limitation of the study.\n",
      "The source of data is used from the 49 participants that have a rich-experience or high-interest in travel professionals with good travel knowledge and always learn much concern from tourism domain.\n",
      "In Table 7, three key results are thus apparent:  Relaxing is the major attribute in both the Openness to change and Conservation groups simultaneously;  most of the participants reveal that pressure and a high workload will induce them to travel for relaxation.\n",
      "This information implies that many people may travel only to escape from daily life.\n",
      "Participant 2: “I want to travel because it can make me feel relaxed.\n",
      "We face pressure during our daily life; hence, once I get the chance, I will travel and see the world, and outdoor activity can energize me.”   Participant 42: “I think the family relationship is important; therefore, I want to travel with them in my free time.\n",
      "7, it is implicitly interpreted that in the opinions of interviews expressed by the experts, the travel motivations for travelers are highlighted to achieve the main purposes of relieving pressure and creating nice memories for further changing their mood to accumulate more experiences, and ultimately they endeavor to maintain a complete metamorphosis during and after their trip.\n",
      "The six core items are belonged to corresponding Values referred to different responses of personal nature for potential travelers, and their importance of Values is identified and implied on this case study.\n",
      "For both the opposite groups of Openness to change and Conservation in Table 7: Regarding the MEC result, this study mines and finds that the attribute Relaxing is a major factor influencing travel motivation of travelers in both the opposite groups, which is just implied that most of the participants make a tourism mainly for the Consequence Relieving pressure, such as a high workload or other social or economic troubles.\n",
      "4: From the three HVM diagrams of the A-C-V chain, a significant result is implied that it may be the main purpose of travelers to break free from confinement or control of daily life since the Attribute Escaping from the hustle of daily life has no important/significant linkage associated with any consequence.\n",
      "7, it impliedly indicates significant evidence that the travelers satisfy with the consequence and value of relieving pressure and creating nice memories for enhancing their mood and storing travel experiences, and further for a near-complete intrinsic change from this trip.\n",
      "The above helpful six items are core features for travelers’ motivating behavior.\n",
      "The empirical results show that members in the Openness to change group are open-minded in that they travel to broaden their view or enhance self-exploration; most people in the Openness to change group think that life is short and therefore seeks to enjoy the moment, and the value of travel for them benefits a brand-new life or an inspiration.\n",
      "Conversely, the members of Conservation group focus on enhancing their close relationships with their families, and their travel motivation is based on the value of changing their mood for the next phase of life, instead of the purpose of relaxing in the Openness to change group.\n",
      "There are two interesting findings regarding differences in attitudes for the travel motivation between the participants and experts.\n",
      "As Table 12 shown, the motivation to travel for most of the participants covers sequentially from physical reasons to abstract values because at least three factors have fallen into the Openness to change, Conservation, and Participant groups of the A-C-V chain.\n",
      "More importantly, the study subsequently highlights the significant use of ISM method for the relative importance to interpret the significance of various travel elements in tourism industries.\n",
      "The study highlights the objectives of identifying important attributes from both technical and managerial perspectives to explore travelers’ motivating behavior with personal values to construct their deeper relationship.\n",
      "From managerial significance view, the study contributes to differentiate the natures of the two groups of Openness to change and Conservation to further know what motivation to affect the travelers’ decisions, such as travel importance and holiday type; thus, interested parties can further see the real reasons for travelers’ decision-making.\n",
      "Regarding technological significance view, the hybrid “PVQ+MEC+ISM” model proposed is a practically limited technique in the travel industry until now; thus, its satisfactory result is differentiated from the past studies, particularly for the comparison analysis of the MEC and ISM methods.\n",
      "Contribution of the study  From the limited literature review to better use our knowledge, the proposed hybrid procedure for the structure of the hybrid “PVQ+MEC+ISM” model associated with the A-C-V chain to explore travel motivation from personal values used in the tourism industry is very fantastic.\n",
      "4.5 Discussion and limitation of the study As the statements noted in Section 1.3, the hybrid “PVQ+MEC+ISM” model is rarely seen in experiencing travel motivation, particularly for tourism industry in Taiwan.\n",
      "In this study, the integration of ISM and MEC methods also wins core performance for travel motivation in the tourism industry.\n",
      "It is also needed to re-modeling the proposed hybrid procedure and re-testing the empirical case data set when applying to district cases from the travel industry like other service industries.\n",
      "5 Conclusions This study has proposed a hybrid procedure to identify the factors in motivation to travel in Taiwan.\n",
      "A means-end chain is used to identify the participants’ travel motivation through the laddering interview technique for the groups of Openness to change and Conservation.\n",
      "Interpretive structural modeling is used, and based on the 17 factors of the A-C-V chain, experts’ opinions are sought, and then an ISM diagram that aims to verify and compare these opinions with factors of travel motivation identified in laddering interviews is built.\n",
      "First, it is suggested that interested parties, such as travel-related industries and stakeholder officers, can apply the combination of travelers’ personal values and the travel destination feature to provide customized service for practical case.\n",
      "Second, as Grosspietsch [33] suggested, tourism managers should know which visual attributes visitors perceive as interesting in preference to others, and then they can use suitable promotional campaigns with travelers [100].\n",

      "Youth travel, in southern European resorts in particular, frequently involves excessive drinking and resultant adverse outcomes, such as blackouts, falls/injuries, accidents, vandalism, fights, sexual risk-taking or assault, and even death .\n",
      "Mirroring a number of coastal European locales in the Mediterranean where this particular type of travel activity is increasing, the Cypriot resort town of Ayia Napa has not only developed into a “clubbing” capital but has also started to experience a series of health ramifications for travelers and locals alike.\n",
      "Clubbing destinations are purposefully packaged and aggressively marketed by transnational tour operators [TO] to that segment of youth travelers seeking hedonistic playgrounds that offer unrestrained drinking and round-the-clock partying with others of their own age, a host of activities that permit behaviors unconstrained by social norms at home, and music and dancing to offer a release from customs of the civilized social spaces of daily life .\n",
      "In this context, informal, multimodal social networks have evolved with sensation-seeking youth travelers at their core who travel to different destinations for similar experiences involving excessive drinking and round-the-clock partying.\n",
      "Within the paradigms of healthy settings and social networks  frequently used by public health researchers, this paper views young adults' elevated nightlife risks as attributable not only to individual factors , but also to the environment that the nightlife and tourism sectors create for the purpose of revenue maximization  as well as the broad complex and dynamic system of the tourism sector involving numerous stakeholders in the creation of the settings and opportunities to cater to this segment of travelers.\n",
      "As a response to increasing health and safety problems linked to behavioral risk taking of youth travelers, Newtonian approaches to understanding the underlying causes of these risk taking behaviors have utilized deterministic, mechanistic, and reductionist principles .\n",
      "Consequently, these models have defined the direction of current efforts to minimize risks, such as health education for youth travelers.\n",
      "In this paper, we intend to:  elucidate the physical space of clubbing settings where health and safety risks unfold for travelers;  delineate the social organization of risk and identify the stakeholders involved;  ascertain the risk exchanges and transactions among primary players;  explore types of adjustments to structural influences with potential for harm reduction; and  propose the use of complexity science to understand the dynamic and complex nature of international nightlife tourism that leads to health and safety risks.\n",
      "2 Clubbing travel and excessive drinking at Mediterranean resorts Although nightlife and party-focused tourism takes place in many locations around the world, the primary spots for clubbing travel span across the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Ionian seas.\n",
      "Among the most established destinations, Spain's Balearic Islands in particular have been popular for international and national travel and have been receiving large numbers of club-goers.\n",
      "Ibiza welcomes one and a half million visitors each summer who are mostly young travelers from the UK, Germany, Italy, and other parts of Spain who are drawn to its international reputation as a nightlife resort, modern dance culture, and ecstasy use .\n",
      "Increases in clubbing destinations represent a response to the immense growth in sensation-seeking youth travelers originating primarily in the UK and Scandinavian countries  who travel to warm destinations for the purpose of partying.\n",
      "International travel to participate in nightlife is an essential element in club-goers functioning as carriers of recreational drug and club cultures around the world.\n",
      "More opportunities for low-cost air travel have allowed more young people to spend more recreational time in other countries .\n",
      "Young tourists originating mainly from Western countries often prefer sun and beach holidays  and frequently include drinking and casual sex in their travel plans.\n",
      "While on holiday, travelers may engage in sexual activities not only with each other, but also with PR staff, strippers, and sexworkers .\n",
      "Youth travel in various contexts has been examined in terms of its health-risk intentions/behaviors as well as the role of advertising in the selling of carefree holidays.\n",
      "Ads for hedonistic holidays that stress the availability of alcohol and sex were found to be instrumental in influencing travelers' decisions in selecting ‘sun and fun’ destinations; in fact tourists are often sold images of destinations steeped in the usual sun, sea, sand, and sex with the addition of spirits .\n",
      "Studies with young travelers from Great Britain and New Zealand have brought to light excessive levels of alcohol consumption and casual sex while away from home .\n",
      "In these studies, not only was travel found to increase the probability of sexual activity, but also young travelers were found to equate vacation-time with loosening of one's sense of responsibility while offering opportunities for unbridled drinking and sexual activity—or a time when anything is permissible .\n",
      "Once preliminary thematic bracketing was completed, data analysis aimed to complete four tasks:  axial coding and memoing to explore themes and relationships between them for clubbing spaces and nightlife activities; engagement of travelers with these milieux; their drinking and sexual behaviors; and relationships and interactions between clubbing tourists, TO reps, D and D venue staff, and locals along with their consequences; and various effects of drinking behaviors;  thick descriptions of the clubbing environment for additional details;  explanations of how nightlife venues and the overall clubbing context influence drinking behaviors and sexual interactions and expose populations to risk; and  conceptual mapping to graphically explore relationships among foregoing themes.\n",
      "Findings delineate the ways this risk-enabling space increases the vulnerability of foreign youth travelers and locals to alcohol bingeing, drug use, and STI/HIV risk.\n",
      "4.1 Risk-enabling space The risk-enabling space of Ayia Napa's nightlife was viewed broadly to include not only the resort topography, geomorphology, and climate but also the Cypriot institutional framework, policies of travel corporations, and related Internet websites .\n",
      "Considering how late in the night  travelers get to sleep, the level of sleep deprivation is not surprising.\n",
      "Primary risk suppliers include TOs and TAs that sell risk-filled travel packages; their onsite holiday representatives  who encourage tourists to drink and party round-the-clock; owners of D and D venues that engage in hard-selling of alcohol to maximize profits via drink specials that use cheap liquor; venue decoration; staff working at D and D venues; local businesses that offer opportunities for extreme sports, including bungee jumping, jet skis, and parasailing; businesses that rent quad bikes to tourists who are often intoxicated; local drug suppliers; visiting and local gangs; and members of the local mafia .\n",
      "Interviewed venue owners in Ayia Napa expressed how these companies can determine not only which destinations tourists go to, but also which venues and accommodations they stay at while there: “…there are different TOs for different countries and they have lots of power in their hands…meaning they somehow control the people that travel with them…what they do is find specific accommodations and promote specific bars and clubs…they formulate the typical day of their clients…there are agreements between hotel owners, club owners, and tour operators…” Club owner, Ayia Napa, 2008   TOs/TAs hire large numbers of young people to serve as holiday reps, whose main responsibilities include answering customer questions and solving problems onsite, conducting welcome meetings for new arrivals, organizing events and activities, transferring guests from airports to hotels and back.\n",
      "“Cheap international travel and open borders within Europe have been commercially exploited to create nightlife resorts where risks to health, such as injury and violence, frequently result from highly intoxigenic environments” .\n",
      "Here recommendations are made to traveler generating countries, traveler receiving countries, governments, non-governmental bodies, and members of the tourism sector.\n",
      "The responsibility for protecting travelers should be shared by all stakeholders.\n",
      "Based on the results of this exploratory ethnographic work, specific recommendations are made for both traveler generating and receiving countries, governments, as well as the tourism sector to minimize risk and increase traveler awareness of hazards .\n",
      "These characteristics can also describe many situations involving large numbers of travelers flowing through regions and engaging in various activities.\n",
      "Key causal pathways can be categorized into five broad sectors:  traveler generating countries;  traveler receiving countries;  governments;  non-governmental organizations; and  members of the tourism sector.\n",
      "We propose utilizing systems, complexity, and chaos science methodologies to better understand health and safety problems experienced by travelers, while underdeveloped, they are highly promising in the context of rapidly increasing complexity, failures, and upcoming challenges affecting the tourism system.\n",

      "To address the aforementioned research gaps, domestic tourists’ motivation and travel intentions are explored in the context of Sichuan, China in the aftermath of the Wenchuan earthquake .\n",
      "Since the debate over the term “dark tourism” is beyond the scope of this study, following the majority of the literature in the field, its definition as “the act of travel to sites associated with death, suffering or the seemingly macabre”  is adopted here.\n",
      "This can be achieved not only by investigating tourists’ varied motivations, but also by examining the travel intentions of potential visitors.\n",
      "Post-disaster destinations, motivations and intentions Motivation is critical for understanding why people travel and engage in a particular activity .\n",
      "While various approaches have been adopted to classify travel motivations, it is generally agreed that push and pull factors are central for understanding the tourist decision-making process .\n",
      "Push factors refer to internal, socio-psychological drivers that create the initial desire to travel, such as escape, rest and relaxation, excitement, novelty seeking, prestige and social interaction .\n",
      "Yet, none of these studies explores the impact of the various motives on tourists’ travel decision or intention to visit the disaster relics as opposed to the destination’s traditional attractions.\n",
      "The decision to focus on individuals living in an area not hit by the earthquake stemmed from the assumption that experiencing a recent disaster would affect individuals’ motivation and travel behavior.\n",
      "Given the aforementioned lack of research into motivations for visiting post-disaster destinations , attention was also given to motives revealed in the dark tourism literature  and general studies on travel motivations .\n",
      "First, the mean scores suggest that considerations of safety and accessibility and the state of tourism infrastructure are the most important features for all three clusters, regardless of their travel interest .\n",
      "Conclusion Drawing on the literature of post-disaster tourism recovery and dark tourism, this study explores domestic tourists’ motivations and travel intentions to visit a disaster-hit destination previously known for its cultural and natural attractions.\n",
      "However, as people react differently to disasters, three distinct market segments, differing in their travel intentions and motivations, were identified.\n",
      "The earthquake had little effect on this segment’s perception of Sichuan or on their travel intentions.\n",
      "Such theory is able to capture the impact of changes to the destinations’ attributes and image on tourist behavior, including, their motivations and travel intentions.\n",

      "Among these segments, the senior group is the most prominent and of considerable importance to regional destinations, due to their great length of travel, reasonable amount of disposable income and strong preference for regions areas .\n",
      "It is part of many senior RV tourists' travel experience.\n",
      "2 Literature review  2.1 Drive tourism Drive tourism is defined as 'travel by any form of mechanically powered, passenger-carrying road transport, with the exclusion of coaches and bicycles' .\n",
      "It thus includes day trip and overnight travel in a family car or a rental car, travel in four-wheel-drive vehicles , travel in RVs, and touring by motorbikes.\n",
      "In the drive tourism area, topics studied to date include, but are not limited to, the following areas: the key factors shaping successful touring routes , the changing nature of the drive market , travel patterns of drive tourists , generic motivations for undertaking drive tourism , the safety issues drive tourists face , the culture of the drive tourist market  and the key issues shaping the sustainability of the sector .\n",
      "A number of researchers have adopted a segmentation approach to inform their work: for example, 4WD drive tourists' experiences in Australian deserts , car-based tourists' spatial patterns in Scotland , the risks of using mopeds in Queensland, Australia , the caravanning tourists and their changing characteristics , and other vehicle users' travel behaviour  .\n",
      "In this study, RV tourism, as a subset of drive tourism, is described as 'a form of tourism where travellers take a camper trailer, van conversion, fifth wheel, slide-on camper, caravan or motorhome on holiday with them, and use the vehicle as their primary form of accommodation' .\n",
      "For example, it is estimated that there are 70,000 to 80,000 RVs travelling on an extended tour around Australia at any one time .\n",
      "Studies about the senior RVers suggest that they prefer travelling to regional and remote communities, thus bringing important economic and social benefits to small towns .\n",
      "Academic analyses of the senior market, especially studies concerning the sub-culture and the participants' travel motivations, offer several insights.\n",
      "A number of their interviewees had joined an organised RV tour to Alaska, and highlighted convenience as well as safety and security concerns as factors determining their choice of this style of RV travel.\n",
      "Much of this work considers the history of the field and notes the use of related terms such as 'benefits', which are the post-travel consequences relevant to classes of motives , and 'expectations', which are anticipatory beliefs about the attributes of destinations and the likelihood of experiences being achieved .\n",
      "Inductive approaches to tourist motivation built on interviews, travel blogs and reworking of industry consultancy reports have been offered .\n",
      "Other inductive and means-ends studies are visible in work on women' travel motives  and on the quest for positive experiences .\n",
      "Instead, travel motivation is best thought of as a fluctuating pattern of motives, which are adjusted for any specific activity but which do show regularities for groups and individuals over time .\n",
      "Thirdly, it is apparent that the full and complex schemes outlining tourist motivation, such as the travel-career pattern, arousal and flow approaches, which are cast as all-encompassing for many kinds of tourists and many forms of tourism, may be too broadly based for any particular study .\n",
      "In these significant ways, one goal of the present work is to move beyond description, and begin to build a theoretical and conceptual model about the dynamic nature of RV motivation with a view to determining the common and evolving travel-career patterns for members of this group .\n",
      "From Table 1, it can be noted that the research sample represents the Grey Nomads group: mostly over 50s travelling with a well or medium self-contained RV and spending quite a bit time on road within their state or across states.\n",
      "Additionally, like other travel groups, it also appears that these experienced travellers are developing some preferences for contact with the visited setting and environment, evident in their activity choices of local shopping and time spent or wanting to be in local natural environments.\n",
      "1 offers additional links to existing work on travel experience and travel-career motivation patterns.\n",
      "In previous studies of tourist motivation patterns, including those examining special-interest issues such as health tourism and the Chinese outbound market, it has been established that inexperienced travellers rate all motives as quite important .\n",
      "By way of contrast, experienced travellers become more discerning and tend to be selective, often emphasising relationships and the connection to environments and host communities as substantially more important than novelty, status and independence .\n",
      "It can be claimed from the demographic information that the sample is an experienced travel group, at least in the context of travelling around Australia.\n",
      "The combined data on activities and motives do highlight the theme of an increasingly specialised motivational pattern for this community of travellers.\n",
      "The motivational dynamics and the trajectory of change for those who prefer to socialise less does prompt a further set of questions about whether this independent travel choice precedes or follows participation in the rallies and the social life of the more engaged RV users.\n",
      "As with other research questions concerning RV users, the further application of ideas assessing travel-career patterns may help researchers not only understand RV users in general but may generate insights into the broader issues of how travel experiences alter the drivers of tourist behaviour.\n",
      "In the motivation work the factors of overall destination attractiveness, including for example, warm weather, a friendly community, scenic views, and local festivals and events, were found to be a powerful motivation force shaping the interest of the senior market, half of whom were inter-state travellers.\n",

      "When employees perceived that the company's image, cost savings and attracting green travellers were considered more important by the hotel than protecting the environment, they were less likely to accept change, as they believed the EMS to be merely another way to increase business.\n",

      "A fourth ontological issue can be added related to the need of “travel” given the use of the word “tourism”  in its label.\n",
      "Finally, an ontological discussion surrounding the definition of agritourism could be added to the preceding debate in relation to the need of “travel”, especially because the term “tourism” is embedded in the label most commonly used in the literature to depict this activity .\n",
      "The World Tourism Organization defines tourism as “the activities of persons traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited” , thus suggesting some sort of travel.\n",
      "However, none of the agritourism definitions reviewed refers to the need of travel, which can be related to the lack of a firm understanding of what travel entails, ranging from minimum distances such as the standard 50-mile one-way used in the U.S.  to the minimum of one overnight stay used in many other countries .\n",
      "In line with such inconsistencies, some agritourism definitions may imply some sort of travel when mainly referring to farm-stays or entailing any type of accommodations , while other studies suggest that agritourism usually entails one-day visits in local communities .\n",
      "Third, from an ontological perspective, this taxonomy-based definition disregards the role that travel may have in defining agritourism.\n",
      "For the purpose of this manuscript, the instrument collected preferences on words commonly used in agritourism definitions , perceived role of “travel” in defining agritourism, and levels of agreement with characteristics used to define agritourism .\n",
      "Definitional elements of agritourism were examined through dichotomous variables representing the 11 words most commonly used in the literature to define agritourism: “agricultural setting”, “education”, “farm”, “ranch”, “travel”, “working”, “entertainment”, “agriculture”, “farming”, “recreation”, and “visitors”.\n",
      "Although agritourism can be understood as the result of blending agriculture and tourism activities, only a small proportion of respondents considered that “agriculture”  or “travel” should be included when defining this type of activity.\n",
      "Similarly, although with no differences across samples, a small proportion of respondents considered “ranch”  and “travel”  as terms to be included in an agritourism definition.\n",
      "Although results for “ranch” should not be considered conclusive as they may be related to an overall low use of such word in Missouri and North Carolina, insights related to “travel” are important as they settled the ontological discussion of whether agritourism should include some sort of travel as its label suggests.\n",

      "  1 ICT strategic implications for business and the travel industry in particular Information technology generates fundamental changes in the nature and application of technology in business.\n",
      "The proliferation of the Internet, as a main stream communication media and as an infostructure for business transactions has generated a wide range of strategic implications for businesses in general as well as for the travel and airline industries in particular.\n",
      "1.2 ICTs in the travel and tourism industries The travel industry already uses a wide range of ICT systems [9,62,69,82].\n",
      "In addition, several internal-management applications facilitate the strategic and operational management and marketing of travel organisations.\n",
      "ICTs support all business functions and are critical for operating in the travel industry as a whole.\n",
      "Few other industries rely on so many partners to collaborate closely for delivering their products and few other value chains are as elaborate as the one for travel [8].\n",
      "The influence of ICTs on travel organisations is pervasive, as information is critical for both day-to-day operations as well as the strategic management of organisations.\n",
      "On the strategic level, travel organisations have to continuously assess all elements of their external environment, as well as their competition and customer needs, and consequently, adapt themselves in order to enhance their competitiveness.\n",
      "ICTs support the strategic management of travel organisations by empowering long-term decision making and by providing a platform for collaboration and transactions between partners.\n",
      "They also help the entire industry to operate by empowering internal processes, co-ordinating partners, as well as by interacting with prospective travellers and the general public.\n",
      "As a result, the recent ICT developments have revolutionised the entire system and have profound implications for both the strategic and tactical management of travel organisations.\n",
      "1.3 ICTs in airlines: research objectives This paper analyses the use of ICTs in airlines as part of the travel industry.\n",
      "They have pioneered the introduction of ICTs as they realised, fairly early, the need for efficient, quick, inexpensive, and accurate handling of their inventory to communicate with travel agencies and other distributors.\n",
      "Up to the 1970s, most travel agencies had to locate the best routes and fares for their customers in a manual .\n",
      "They also enabled airlines to communicate with travel agencies, consolidators and other distributors and to update routes, availability and prices constantly.\n",
      "Most major CRSs installed terminals in travel agencies to assist remote printing of travel documents such as tickets and boarding passes, itineraries and invoices.\n",
      "They also improved the efficiency in arranging sales settlements between airlines and travel agencies, and empowered frequent flyer programmes.\n",
      "In the mid-1980s, airline and CRS executives realised that air transportation was a fairly small part of a much more complex travelling experience.\n",
      "GDSs still provide the backbone mechanism for communication between principals and travel agencies.\n",
      "Since the early 1990s, GDSs effectively became travel supermarkets, offering information and reservation capabilities for the entire range of travel products, including accommodation, car rentals, schedules for non-air transportation, etc.\n",
      "GDSs enabled travel agencies to access all essential information on their screens and to develop comprehensive travel itineraries from the convenience of one inter-connected system.\n",
      "These GDSs compete fiercely for recruiting travel agencies and for penetrating the marketplace and aim to do that by developing a number of value-added services for travel agencies and airlines [71].\n",
      "In the Internet era, GDSs as independent business from airlines developed their offerings to provide the backbone for the entire industry to establish the infostructure for the transactions undertaken by a number of Internet travel portals.\n",
      "In addition, they gradually reinvented themselves to main technology suppliers for a wide range of tourism organisations including airlines, travel agencies and Internet travel portals.\n",
      "In addition, a number of articles and books that demonstrated the historic development of ICTs in travel and air-transportation provided the strategic management framework and identified critical applications.\n",
      "They claimed that it was easier for no-frills airlines to take advantage of the Internet, as they had no established distribution network and dedicated departments to look after travel agencies.\n",
      "Interaction with distributors, travel agencies, and other distributors can determine levels of sales whilst efficient invoicing and revenue collection is critical for both cash flow and profitability.\n",
      "Airlines had to invest significantly in their ICT systems in the late 1990s in order to develop interfaces with consumers and the travel trade.\n",
      "Interviewees suggested that they desperately need to promote their web site as their primary reservation path and as an alternative to the GDS/travel agency route.\n",
      "5.2.2 Distribution, marketing and sales support with partners The vast majority of airlines rely heavily on travel agencies for distributing their products.\n",
      "Interviewees suggested that the link with travel agencies is normally facilitated by Global Distribution Systems that provide the infostructure for itinerary building and facilitate the entire transaction.\n",
      "However, airline executives explained that they would like to transact with travel agencies on an Extranet, over the Internet, in order to avoid that GDS’s booking fees for lower fares.\n",
      "For example, British Airways has developed a dedicated web site for the travel trade  that can be developed to an Extranet in order to facilitate this process.\n",
      "However, travel agencies may gradually find some useful financial features.\n",
      "Although connecting is technically possible, interviewees suggested that travel agencies are reluctant to follow this route, partly because they prefer comparing all schedules and prices on a GDS and partly because GDSs provide incentives and they have long term contractual agreements with them.\n",
      "Web sites also assisted airlines to launch another communication and purchasing channel in order to reduce the power and costs of conventional intermediaries such as travel agencies and GDSs.\n",
      "Air transportation accounts for approximately 65% of all travel eCommerce.\n",
      "This enables them to bypass travel agencies and their commissions.\n",
      "The ability to disintermediate travel agencies has also enabled airlines to cut down commission rates.\n",
      "In addition, electronic ticketing and ticketless travel have gradually reduced distribution, fulfilment, and labour costs whilst increasing efficiency.\n",
      "Continental Airlines is often quoted as an example of an airline which decreased its cost by $ 20 million simply by reducing commissions to travel agencies and by introducing electronic ticketing.\n",
      "Co-opetition was the main driver of the development of Orbitz and Opodo as independent Internet travel agencies by airlines on both sides of the Atlantic in order to reduce the power of electronic travel agencies, such as Expedia and Travelocity, and to develop alternative distribution channels.\n",
      "Orbitz was designed to gives access to travellers to reservations across several airlines as well as to car rental, hotels, vacation packages, and other travel products.\n",
      "These systems offer unbiased and competitively priced online travel service for world travel, with access to flights from over 400 airlines, 30,000 hotel properties, and over 11,000 car hire locations worldwide, as well as travel insurance.\n",
      "7 ICT-enabled airlines of the future Airlines are one of the most interdependent organisations in the travel industry.\n",
      "Technologies can improve the entire customer travelling experience.\n",
      "Frequent travellers demand speedier check-in processes and a higher degree of flexibility and control over their own travel arrangements.\n",
      "Self-service kiosk applications will increasingly support travellers make travel reservations, check-in, receive boarding passes, select seats, check frequent flier miles, request upgrades, purchase a ticket, print eTicket receipts, or check bags—all without waiting in-line for an agent.\n",
      "ICTs will therefore be used dynamically before, during and after the travel experience to serve passengers and to reinforce the airline brand.\n",
      "The ability of travellers to connect from virtually anywhere with their wireless devices and adapt their itinerary is expected to be one of the most widely used services [10].\n",

      "Indeed, the wide portfolio of online information resources may act as both a facilitator and a barrier within a traveller's vacation decision-making process.\n",
      "In effect, the online information-seeking process of travellers is rather complex; travellers are motivated to select and use multiple online information sources based on inherent travel-related information needs that relate to the vacation planning decision-making [14].\n",
      "Especially for practitioners in the tourism industry, there is a growing need to understand how tourists interact in the online medium and receive travel-related information to explore ways to leverage it.\n",
      "In effect, our study differentiates from extant literature by capturing the interrelations between travel-related information needs, online information sources and personal information barriers to explain satisfaction stemming from the online information search process of travellers.\n",
      "On the basis of the above, the paper addresses the following research question: What configurations of information needs, information sources, information barriers and personal traits lead to satisfied travellers when they search for travel-related information online?\n",
      "The contribution of the paper lies in identifying the level of agreement between information needs, information sources utilization, information barriers and overall information satisfaction and, therefore, assist tourism marketers to develop better strategies for providing information desired by potential travellers.\n",
      "The outcomes of this effort are encapsulated in alternative traveller search profiles that equally lead to satisfied travel-related information needs.\n",
      "Section 2 presents the related work on capturing the online information-seeking behaviour of travellers and articulates the research propositions.\n",
      "2 Related work  2.1 Capturing travellers’ online information search process during travel planning Travel planning reflects a specific type of information search and an important component of any trip experience since it involves all traveller activities pertaining to the collection of information in order to develop a travel plan [20].\n",
      "Such sources include the Internet, travel consultants or agents, their family and friends, and offline literature/media pertaining to the destination under consideration [3].\n",
      "Specifically in the online domain, such individuals are seeking information in order to explore specific travel experiences and tourist destination attributes which suite their travel expectations, socioeconomic and cultural profiles [24], and certain lifestyle backgrounds [25].\n",
      "The information needs and information-seeking preferences literature in the tourism context include numerous theoretical and empirical studies all striving to capture individuals’ search behaviour by identifying travellers’ needs and sources’ preferences .\n",
      "In these studies, emphasis is being paid to identify why travellers search online and what type of websites they frequently access in order to pinpoint prospective online traveller profiles accounting also for demographic information, such as age and gender .\n",
      "However, these efforts mostly reflect partial snapshots of the online information-seeking behaviour since they do not relate the information sources’ usage with particular information needs, nor do they examine whether such relation led to satisfaction of travellers’ information needs.\n",
      "In effect, the different information-seeking profiles differentiate the way groups of people with distinct socioeconomic backgrounds search for information, evaluate and analyze it, manage tourism information, use it and reuse it for specific travel decisions and the way they effectively share and communicate it to others.\n",
      "At the core of the information search process are information needs; they are the drivers that initiate the information search process [16,31] and forge expectations to travellers pertaining to the accumulation of sufficient information that will satisfy these needs.\n",
      "Online information sources in the context of tourism may be classified based on their formality [27]: Formal  online information sources include online travel agents, online travel guides and travel organizers to name but a few popular information sources; informal  online information sources include blogs and online social networks.\n",
      "The type and selection of a particular information source is dependent on the information needs of the traveller  and the inherent barriers that the information source and/or the individual entail.\n",
      "Moreover, they represent parts of travellers’ online search strategies both actively and passively [40].\n",
      "For example, travellers tend to primarily visit formal online information sources to get informed about renowned destinations [35].\n",
      "However, to lower risk and uncertainty in ambiguous selection choices travellers make extensive use of informal information sources  to collect other travellers’ experiences as the tourism product is highly experiential in nature [27,37].\n",
      "At the same time, online visitors rarely complete their travel-related search in one session nor do they devote the same time in each information source [41].\n",
      "Likewise, travellers tend to use online information sources during different stages of their information search process.\n",
      "Trust plays an influential role in information source selection for travellers, although findings are mixed in terms of the degree of trustworthiness for available information sources and their effects on information satisfaction.\n",
      "Along this line, personal factors, in the form of travellers’ information literacy , have been reported to drive both the selection of alternative information sources and/or lead to different degrees of information satisfaction [30,54].\n",
      "For example, senior travellers tend to favour online information sources that provide consolidated travel information to minimize search costs [55].\n",
      "Based on the above, it is evident that the information search process of travellers during vacation planning is a complex practice, which requires scholars to shed light in the relations between the interweaved constituting components.\n",
      "2.2 Research propositions Our work is based on the premise that online information resources enable travellers to become more informed and empowered during their travel planning information search activities.\n",
      "Furthermore, our work seeks to explore paths towards tourism information needs satisfaction as a result of utilization of online information resources that influence travel decisions and the information obstacles related to the information-seeking process.\n",
      "This is central if we consider that literature reveals that individuals utilize a combination of different online information resources to satisfy their information needs for a travel product or service [14,16] and that the selection of these resources is driven by the formulation of specific information needs [20,29] and influenced by situational and/or personal factors .\n",
      "Hence, there is an interaction between the constituent components of the online information-seeking behaviour of travellers , which makes it unclear whether we can assume that a particular combination of them may warrant information satisfaction.\n",
      "In this research, we posit that although the aforementioned components of the online information-seeking behaviour matter individually for each traveller, the synergetic nature between them creates a complex, multi-dimensional phenomenon, in which the configuration of these components is more important than the individual component.\n",
      "First, there is a positive association between traveller expectations from the information search process  and the satisfaction they receive as an end result [59].\n",
      "Second, out of the plethora of online information sources, individuals attribute increased importance, and consequent usage intensity, on those sources that better satisfy their inherent travel-related information needs [16,20,62].\n",
      "Our study proposes that travellers may achieve information satisfaction through combinations of groups of information needs, utilization of specific online information sources and interventions of specific information obstacles/facilitators.\n",
      "This line of reasoning leads to a conceptual framework to explain and better understand travellers’ online information-seeking behaviour on the basis of complexity theory.\n",
      "Such an approach has not been applied in extant literature to capture the online information-seeking behaviour of individuals seeking travel information and may be employed to develop new traveller profiles.\n",
      "From the aforementioned argumentation, we formulate the following research propositions: Proposition 1  There is not an optimal configuration of travellers’ information needs, selection of information sources and associated information barriers that lead to high information satisfaction; instead, multiple and equally effective configurations exist, which include combinations of causal factors.\n",
      "This proposition suggests that travellers’ information satisfaction may not be universally achieved through a single combination of information-seeking behaviour constituents.\n",
      "Extant studies document that individuals searching for travel-related information online may be satisfied through different ways on the basis of their inherent  information needs that, in turn, drive the selection of alternative online information sources through the filter of specific information barriers [16,20,27,35].\n",
      "For example, individuals searching online for logistics-related destination information, such as hotels and restaurants, may visit online social networks or online travel guides to collect information and satisfy these information needs [14,28].\n",
      "Proposition 2  Single information-seeking behaviour conditions  may be required to be present or absent within configurations that explain perceptions of travellers’ high information satisfaction from online travel information sources, depending on how they combine with each other.\n",
      "The second proposition practically suggests that travellers do not commonly follow the same perceptions pattern within the configurations space that explains their satisfaction from the online information search process.\n",
      "For instance, travellers that primarily visit formal online resources  and travellers that primarily visit informal online sources  may equally satisfy the same information needs.\n",
      "3 Methods  3.1 Data A survey was developed and administered to customers of a major travel agency in Greece to collect data and measure the constructs of the research model.\n",
      "The mailing list included information of 3718 clients or users that had registered to receive newsletters from the travel agency.\n",
      "Information needs are measured through three constructs that represent the types of needs experienced by potential travellers: Pleasure and logistics, Transportation and weather, and Testimonials [68].\n",
      "The former describe online sources that are solely concerned with providing travel-related information, while the latter include online media that build on social interaction of users and are not exclusively oriented towards travel and tourism.\n",
      "A black circle in the condition ‘Males’, which examines the gender of the sample, implies that the solution requires the presence of male travellers.\n",
      "A white circle in the same condition implies that the solution is applicable for female travellers .\n",
      "The same principles apply for the condition ‘Young Travellers’; black circles suggest that the solution applies to travellers of up to the age of 30 years, whilst white circles suggest that the solution applies to travellers over 30 years of age.\n",
      "From these 13 solutions, the first three describe combinations that are applicable to males, while the next two are for female travellers.\n",
      "Overall, results demonstrate that both formal travel websites and informal websites are significant contributors to user satisfaction yet for different types of information and for different profiles of users.\n",
      "Extant research confirmed the complexity of travellers’ online information search process and documented the necessity of devising informed decision aids to mitigate risks and uncertainty during travel-related online information seeking [14,27,28].\n",
      "This study answers this challenge by providing an explanatory lens on the conditions leading travellers to choose among different online information sources to satisfy their travel planning information needs.\n",
      "Our findings validate scholars’ consensus that travellers combine different online information sources to satisfy their information needs [16,70].\n",
      "Previous tourism information search studies have endorsed this relation to explain travellers’ information channel preferences  [20,78].\n",
      "Scholars have recognized the importance of both trust perceptions on the quality/reliability of travel information that is published on the Internet [52], especially for information posted on online social networks [15,53], and of personal characteristics  on the selection and usage intensity of online information sources.\n",
      "This paper differentiates from the majority of previous studies on the area of online travel information seeking that use symmetric methods  to analyze and explain an individual's online information-seeking behaviour.\n",
      "Extant studies on the antecedents of satisfaction in online travel-related information seeking focus on the average effects of single variables rather than on the effects of combinations  of several variables [11,16,20,27,35,70,81].\n",
      "From a theoretical standpoint, our findings indicate complex patterns among travellers’ information-seeking behaviour components and verify the proposed asymmetric relationships that may lead to high degrees of information satisfaction.\n",
      "Hence, this research paves the ground for the development of a traveller-centred theoretical model through the identification of alternative ‘recipes’ that may be considered as ‘atypical’ traveller profiles, which equally predict information satisfaction from consuming online travel information.\n",
      "5.2 Elaboration on the information satisfaction paths The information satisfaction paths disclose a number of interesting conclusions, which may be used by travel information stakeholders for the design of more traveller-centred search/display means within online information sources.\n",
      "Starting from the information needs, our study advocates that travellers searching for transportation and weather information visit formal online information sources , whilst travellers seeking testimonials of other tourists tend to visit informal online information sources .\n",
      "Moreover, travellers seeking for local information and attractions give equal priorities in both formal and informal online information sources.\n",
      "Travellers seeking information pertaining to a particular destination tend to initially get informed through information aggregators, which outline the highlights of the destination under scrutiny and, then, confirm or expand their information space through reviewing other travellers’ experiences.\n",
      "Our study also showcases the role of trust in the selection and consumption of online travel information.\n",
      "In effect, travellers that raise concerns regarding the accuracy and validity of provided information on the Internet prefer to use formal online information sources.\n",
      "Nevertheless, travellers that consider the available online travel information as trustworthy exhibit a mixed behaviour.\n",
      "One cluster  is rather indifferent in its information sources preferences and comprises female travellers over 30 years old.\n",
      "A second cluster , comprising male travellers, prefers to satisfy the accumulated travel information needs through formal information sources.\n",
      "This atypical profiling based on trust perceptions provides helpful insights regarding possible redirections of online travellers to candidate information sources to warrant high information satisfaction.\n",
      "Specifically, individuals that report information literacy inadequacies also do not trust the information on the Internet and they do not expect to satisfy any of their travel planning information needs.\n",
      "As such, these individuals, comprising young travellers, will never use informal information sources.\n",
      "Finally, our study also confirms the influence of gender and age in the online information-seeking profiles of travellers [18,68].\n",
      "Males tend to prioritize satisfaction of information needs related to destination information  through informal information sources; females also emphasize on transportation and weather travel information, but they do not attribute any core preference to a specific type of online information source.\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, travellers of younger ages do not seem to trust the available online travel information; thus, they do not expect to satisfy information needs related to learning about other visitors’ experiences.\n",
      "5.3 Implications for stakeholders in tourism development The study findings reinforce the argument that travellers should be treated as ‘hybrid’ information consumers, relying on multiple information sources to meet their information needs.\n",
      "In effect, the fsQCA information satisfaction paths establish the generic search patterns that travellers follow when they seek for travel-related information on the Internet.\n",
      "Because the information-seeking patterns relate travel information needs with specific online information sources and demographic/personal traits, stakeholders in tourism development may exploit these traveller profiles to understand the underlying rationale of travellers’ decisions and, ultimately, use more efficiently the different online information sources to develop more effective traveller-centric communication strategies and influence travellers’ decision-making.\n",
      "For example, our findings may inform the design of search engine marketing campaigns and/or search filters used by travel websites to better meet visitors’ information needs.\n",
      "The fsQCA solutions describe how travellers select between different information sources according to their specific information needs and personal properties.\n",
      "Online marketers may link these needs and properties with product offerings and promotion campaigns within a website, employ them to adjust their search engine optimization practices, or use them for redirecting travellers to specific websites as part of organic or paid listings in search engines.\n",
      "The information satisfaction paths that were identified through the fsQCA analysis may also serve as the basis for improving the functionality and interfaces of existing travel websites.\n",
      "Specifically, the produced traveller profiles may inform the development of personalization and recommender systems in the context of tourism information providers.\n",
      "An example of personalization feature that may be included in travel websites includes predictive search elements based on the information needs of travellers.\n",
      "Moreover, the sample population was from a single travel agent in Greece and was dominated by young travellers .\n",
      "Extending the sample with more senior travellers and an international sample will certainly provide additional insights, even in the form of additional paths towards information satisfaction, in the online information search behaviour of travellers.\n",
      "Finally, our study adopted a utilitarian perspective on travel information needs.\n",
      "We acknowledge that travel information needs also have a hedonic element  [87].\n",

      "The kilometres travelled not only depend on how many people choose to travel from A to B, but also on the connectivity of destinations.\n",
      "Thus, the carbon efficiency of travel per passenger kilometre  has increased in the order of 1–1.5% per annum ; a rate that reflects ongoing industry commitments .\n",
      "To monitor overall carbon emissions, we propose the concept of carbon usage , which for this research is defined as the aviation carbon emissions associated with all travel departing from a particular destination .\n",
      "In addition, a normalised indicator measures the share of travellers in business and first class .\n",
      "The average travel distance per passenger provides information on the extent of long-haul connections, whilst the detour factor measures the difference between the direct travel distance  and the actual flight path.\n",
      "The share of passengers travelling on itineraries under 400 km is of interest, because it provides information on the hypothetical substitution potential with other forms of transport or, longer term, solar-powered planes.\n",
      "The database provides information on idiosyncratic travel itineraries booked each month .\n",
      "When the traveller returns, a new itinerary is recorded in the database .\n",

      "This is explained by the relatively high share of domestic travel originating from Beijing, compared with the other international airports.\n",
      "The carbon intensity of air travel from different airports differs considerably, with a median of 0.11 CO2/pkm and a standard deviation of 0.055.\n",

      "One problem is that neither air travellers nor decision makers have access to detailed data on the emissions associated with each route.\n",
      "A system of air travel emissions specific to each flight would be of great value to concerned customers.\n",
      "Another key factor in the level of carbon risk relates to the route network and the distance that people travel.\n",

      "The average annual climate budget of each person would be about 2.3 tonnes of CO2 , a constraint that would make frequent air travel difficult.\n",
      "These relate to strategic partnerships with airlines that can deliver better carbon efficiencies and most direct routes to key markets, shifts in marketing campaigns, provision of information for travellers , demand management and shift-and-avoid policies, and a shortening of supply chains more broadly.\n",

      "The second survey was a face-to-face interview with 4046 visitors in 40 forests throughout Wallonia, on their profiles, travel behaviours and satisfaction .\n",
      "3 Model profile  3.1 Design concept A modelling study on the spatial pattern of leisure activity and visit pattern in forests may start with the following questions: “who are the visitors?”, “where are they from?”, “where do they go?” and “why do they go there?” The first question relates to individuals' social and economic profile , which may affect their trip purposes, decision making and travel behaviours  .\n",
      "Visitors from the same group were assumed to share a similar motivation and travel behaviour.\n",
      "The visitors' travel behaviours were distinguished between weekdays and weekends.\n",
      "It also included municipality-level parameters such as the population , that could influence the people's time budget for leisure activity , and the proportion of the forest area, that could influence the distance travelled .\n",
      "Parameters found relative to the travel distance in Li .\n",
      "After that, travel group agents were generated and decisions on forest leisure visits were made via the sub-model 2 .\n",
      "Each agent performed its behaviours to decide whether or not to travel to a forest estate in Wallonia in five steps:  an agent was generated with visitor-level characteristics;  a potential distance for travel was estimated based on visitor- and residential-level characteristics;  based on the potential distance estimated, a number of forest estates were selected as potential destinations for consideration,  given these potential destinations, the agent decided whether or not to travel out of Wallonia based on a gross regional measure of attractiveness , the forest area, and  if the decision was to travel inside Wallonia, the agent decided whether to travel to a forest estate from those potential destinations inside Wallonia based on the local estimation of their attractiveness.\n",
      "The agents that successfully travelled to a forest estate in Wallonia would update the “daily visitors” and “weekly visitors” attributes of both its origin and destination.\n",
      "If all agents from the same urban area finished their decisions and travels, the programme went on to consider the next urban area from the dataset .\n",
      "3.4.2 Sub-model 2 – Decision making on forest leisure trips When a travel group agent was generated, the following behaviours  were applied successively to decide on whether to travel to a forest estate .\n",
      "Behaviour I – Estimating the size of travel group The size of the travel group was generated randomly in two steps: first, a travel group category was assigned  following the probabilities calculated from the phone survey ; then, a number of visitors was generated for the travel group category  derived from the field interview data .\n",
      "Behaviour II – Estimating a potential travel distance The potential travel distance  was estimated using a function modified from a statistical analysis of travel distance developed in Li .\n",
      "Random intercept functions had been adapted to consider the influence of two-level factors, , visitors' profile factors  and residential  characteristics , on the travel distance  for forest visits on weekdays  and weekends : e 0.39∗ln + 0.29∗c  − 2.54∗p   w  + 1.28 +  R  0 +  U  00 and e 0.41∗ln + 0.35∗c  − 2.31∗p   w  + 1.15 +  R  0 +  U  00, where visit length , car usage  and proportion of forest area in residential municipality  are the key determinants; R 0 and U 00 are error terms at the visitor and residential levels, which follow normal distributions of N and N respectively.\n",
      "Based on the field interviews, we examined distribution parameters for visit length  and probability of car usage , which were found to vary with categories of travel group but not with the days of the week .\n",
      "However, in the final multivariate model for travel distance, these factors were dropped using a stepwise approach.\n",
      "To identify such ranges, we analysed the travel distance data from Li .\n",
      "using Jenks natural breaks optimization method , for how travel distances were clustered.\n",
      "In total 10 breaks were identified , resulting in ten sub-ranges of travel distances.\n",
      "As a result, given a potential travel distance estimated in Behaviour II, one sub-range of travel distances could be identified.\n",
      "Behaviour IV – Deciding on whether to travel inside Wallonia Since information on forest characteristics outside Wallonia were unavailable, we used the area of the forest as a gross regional approximation for the attractiveness.\n",
      "Agents travelling out of Wallonia were excluded.\n",
      "Empirical functions for travel distance  and forest attractiveness  were initially developed using R statistical language  and then integrated into the model.\n",
      "They included the potential population of forest visitors, travel distance and forest attractiveness.\n",
      "This related to the limited time budget for leisure activities assumed for weekdays, that most travel group agents chose to travel closer .\n",
      "On weekends, when travel group agents were allowed to spend more time for leisure, their visits spread over to the south of the Walloon territory, where forests' attractiveness values were higher .\n",
      "As to the origins of forest travellers, urban areas with higher population and closer distance to the forests provided most of the visitors on both weekdays and weekends.\n",
      "4.3 Sensitivity analysis The regional number of forest visitors was sensitive to the changes in the population of potential forest visitors  and travel distance .\n",
      "Increases in travel distance, , as results of an increased time budget for leisure or/and an increased use of car in travel, could largely decrease the leisure visits in most forests close to major towns in the central and southern regions of Wallonia, while exponentially increasing the visits in a few remote but highly attractive forests .\n",
      "The effect of overall forest attractiveness increase, , in relation to the changes of variables on land use status and natural features in Table 3, had driven more travel group agents to visit more attractive forests, resulting in a loss of visitors in less attractive forests nearby.\n",
      "With these empirical functions, we could then predict  how far a group of visitors might travel and  how frequently a forest estate might be visited.\n",
      "5.2 Comparison with previous studies Comparing to the existing regional models on the spatial patterns of forest visits , the present approach showed a general consistency on emphasising the importance of distance travelled for forest and forest attractiveness , while using a more comprehensive framework.\n",
      "Travel distance has been largely considered as an important parameter in travel demand analysis and modelling.\n",
      "Most existing empirical studies on the distance travelled for green space recreation consider factors operating at the individual level about visitors' profile and travel behaviour , or higher levels such as residential socio-demographics  or destination land use attributes .\n",
      "In the three existing modelling studies , the distance travelled was modelled using distance-decay  functions, by approximating the negative relationship between trip frequency and travel distance .\n",
      "However, their explanatory power on determinants of distance travelled is limited.\n",
      "In our study, by taking advantages of the available visitor-level data, an empirical function was developed to shed more light on the local determinants of distance travelled for forest recreation.\n",
      "The total variance in the individual travel distances was largely  explained by the residential-level variance, suggesting a multi-level regression model was more suitable.\n",
      "As a result, longer travel distances were found for visitors who located more time to forest leisure, travelled by car, and lived in less forested municipalities, which corresponded well with other existing studies .\n",
      "Consequently, destination attractiveness has been largely considered as an important component in destination choice and travel demand models , including for forest visits .\n",
      "Different weights were qualitatively assigned to the accessibility, tranquillity, scenery and infrastructure quality indicator for different travel modes.\n",
      "Empirical analysis of the best available data was conducted to better our understanding of the local key determinants of travel distance and forest attractiveness.\n",
      "In the next step, more agent types could be included, by which trips with different purposes , more complex structures  and using different travel modes  can be represented specifically.\n",
      "For example, a traveller agent desiring to escape from life's pressure may opt for simple relaxation trips to tranquil forests.\n",
      "This should further help us answer structural model questions, for example, on the relative importance of travel distance and forest attractiveness – which should be considered firstly in the model?\n",
      "A priority was assumed for travel distance in the present study, but in reality should the relative importance be varying?\n",
      "Even at a daily or weekly level, individual travel behaviours may be influenced by weather conditions and such influences can be highly dependent on trip purpose .\n",
      "However, the exclusion was mainly due to the lack of good road network data and, most importantly, an underdeveloped knowledge of travel mode choice mechanisms in the study area.\n",
      "Thus, more causal relationships between travel behaviours  and environmental factors are needed, for which visitor-level behavioural studies should be prioritised.\n",
      "6 Conclusion An agent-based model was developed for quantifying the regional-level forest visit pattern by day leisure trips, based on the functions of local participation, individual travel distance and forest attractiveness.\n",

      "2.2 Quality and sustainability of host-visitor experiences Scientific literature from the 1960s categorizes the most used tourism typologies into two groups: 1) space structure of tourism development  and 2) role played by the tourist  and suggests that tourism typologies and classifications should be grouped in two categories: 1) interactional or behavioral type due to the emphasis in the relationships established between visitors and destination areas; and 2) cognitive-normative or motivational type, since it accounts for the previous motivations to travel .\n",
      "Subsequently, the ULSA Tourism Investigation Institute characterized different interpretative models of tourism development in order to understand the complexity of social interactions using theoretical systems, such as Smith's model which links the volume and type of tourists to the degree of adaptation to the local norms; Doxey's Irridex that postulates that the interaction of local residents with a large number of tourists generates tension and finally leads to antagonism; Plog's Psychographic Profile which associates the evolution of the destination with the travelers' psychology; and Butler's Host Attitudinal Response model, in which social interactions are based in the different stages of evolution within the tourism area life cycle .\n",

      "According to Revinate , 93% of international travelers have stated that online opinions have an impact on their hotel booking decisions; 79% consider that a bad review increases their distrust on the hotel; thus, the traveler's opinions have a strong competitive pressure, a high booking impact and influences over the reputation of hotels and tourist destinations.\n",
      "Data was obtained through interviews with 12 specialists from the Cooper Canyon Adventure Park and the tourism department of the state and municipality, 23 national and international researchers consulted through social and research networks, 11 social science academics with specialization in tourism, geography, sociology, economics, administration and community work, and 6 managers from 4 hotels and 2 local travel agencies.\n",
      "An online opinion survey was posted on websites including, Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Tripadvisor.com, through which information regarding travelers' opinions was collected.\n",
      "This would imply greater sensitivity to the sustainability aspects of the destination, and, consequently, would favor the destination's positioning within the specialized market of sustainable travel.\n",
      "No recorded guest opinions relate satisfaction with the destination to interactions with the native communities which gives the impression that a bubble is generated in which the visitors are isolated from the local population, especially from the indigenous, while the websites of the destination and hotel companies themselves do not provide a direct option to receive comments on this matter, thus devaluing an attractive potential of very high hierarchy within the sustainable travel market segment.\n",
      "It should be noted that these certifications have become very ‘fashionable’ and appealing among potential tourists as a criterion for decision-making regarding travel choices; therefore, companies proudly display these along with other awards and certifications of quality and sustainability, in order to reinforce market influence through internet sites.\n",
      "It is necessary to develop local-level strategies as other destinations have adopted  to ensure a satisfactory nexus of interests and expectations among hosts and visitors  and to facilitate the creation of memorable travel experiences within the destination.\n",
      "From a marketing perspective, such measures could create a unique identity for the destination, and allow for adjustments to be made to meet the demands of the growing sustainable travel market segment for high value tourism products in terms of quality and sustainability.\n",

      "Yet as a global activity, tourism is deeply affected by phenomena such as globalisation and the networked economy , while the discretionary nature of leisure travel means that demand is strongly impacted by context .\n",
      "The industry is already being affected by other major changes in the macro environment, such as the effects of increased Airport Passenger Duty  [ABTA, 2013]; the EU's Emission Trading System  [European Commission, 2013]; and the challenge from online retail and the breaking up of the travel supply chain.\n",
      "Potentially this initiative also has implications for the carriers' relationships with their customers and other stakeholders, including other travel organizations in the supply chain.\n",
      "We use the framework to reveal that carriers and travel organizations engage in a process of recognizing, rationalizing and refashioning in order to manage the negative consequences of compliance and restore their commercial interests.\n",
      "The programme requires that all travel carriers collect and electronically transmit travel document information – also called advanced passenger information  – as well as service information, for all individuals travelling out of the EU.\n",
      "Data must be transferred to the UK Border Agency , between 24 hours and 30 minutes before travel.\n",
      "The UK BA checks the details against watch lists of individuals judged to pose a risk to national security and analyses the data for unusual patterns of travel behaviour.\n",
      "Specifically, travel agents, tour operators and seat brokers are all affected by e-Borders and have developed processes and implemented systems to collect and transfer the required information to the carriers.\n",
      "The rationale for involving commercial organizations in a government's national security programme is that these firms have direct contact with their customers, enabling them to collect passenger identity and travel behaviour data.\n",
      "The disruption which e-Borders has caused is to the regulatory environment of travel firms, yet the aspects affecting the initiative's success are the same as those associated with any upheaval in the macro setting.\n",
      "Against a decline in market share prompted by low cost airlines and online retailers, APD and ETS, the e-Borders requirement is another threat to tour operators and travel agents.\n",
      "Moreover, the implication of adhering to e-Borders’ requirements is that collaboration of other players in the carriers' network – such as the travel agents or seat bookers – is required.\n",
      "The characteristics of the e-Borders initiative, the multiple parties affected within the travel supply chain, and the nature of the collaborations occurring between them, mean that stakeholder analysis is an appropriate analytical framework to use.\n",
      "For instance, the travel agents, tour operators and seat brokers which sell tickets on behalf of carriers are also affected by the need for compliance.\n",
      "To fulfill these requirements, because of the nature of the travel supply chain, the carriers must ensure that other travel firms provide them with the required data.\n",
      "The long-term impact of e-Borders on the relationships between stakeholders and on the commercial interests of carriers and other travel organizations therefore merits scrutiny.\n",
      "This method of data gathering also enabled us to question the tensions highlighted by the travel industry to the Home Affairs Committee , pp.\n",
      "Three main codes were central to the findings:  cross-fertilization – whether information, data or practices implemented for e-Borders has been used in other formats, such as marketing;  de-stabilization – where the standardized means of operation has been disrupted by the e-Borders initiative; and  impacts – considering how travel companies have changed the operational practices and systems used in conducting their business.\n",
      "While airlines, tour operators and travel agents share the Agency's concerns about the security of travel, they must also protect their commercial interests by keeping their costs down, and by ensuring smooth and efficient travel experiences for their customers.\n",
      "Compliance with e-Borders was seen as conflicting with the commercial interests of travel firms due to the costs and other resources involved, disruption caused to established operations and ways of working, and negative effects on customers and on service quality.\n",
      "Even though many firms had invested heavily in designed websites to meet e-Borders requirements, customers were often slow or reluctant to understand their responsibilities, with many contacting the travel organizations for help in-putting their API data.\n",
      "Other tensions also emerged, with retail travel agencies being reluctant for their customers to visit the carrier's website to provide their data, in case they lost ownership of that customer relationship.\n",
      "If you’re a cynical travel agent like we are, you might say, well, hang on a moment; if they fill in all that information … what's to stop you using that data for other marketing activities.\n",
      "Discussions involving pan-industry bodies on behalf of airlines and other travel firms also took place.\n",
      "Competing travel firms worked together through pan-industry trade bodies to influence the development of e-Borders.\n",
      "After the implementation of e-Borders, the relationships between businesses in the travel supply chain and between those businesses and government were destabilised.\n",
      "Although carriers have become the focal point in the emerging structure, they rely heavily on tour operators and travel agents to collect data from customers; and on the government to define the requirements.\n",
      "5.3 Long term structure and outcomes Following the initial roll out of e-Borders, carriers and other travel organizations engaged in a process of developing and embedding their responses to the requirements.\n",
      "Nevertheless, there remained a strong tension between the travel industry and e-Borders requirements, centring on the difficulty in balancing the demands of regulatory compliance with those of managing customer relationships.\n",
      "Frontline workers apparently are ever mindful that the “challenge is [to] keep up customer services levels” and report doing what they can to advise customers on what they must do in order to travel.\n",
      "Although placing this burden on the customer reduces costs, it could in the future lead to customers sourcing their own travel products.\n",
      "We found evidence that APIS requirements are leading to turf wars as travel organizations grapple with whether “they tell the customer to go somewhere else to input the data or do they collect it there and then?” .\n",
      "Some carriers have dealt with such data concerns by developing microsites to ensure that the information is held securely, while others spoke of their procedures for deleting data after passengers have travelled.\n",
      "A large travel agent captured the general nervousness around this issue, summarising the situation from their viewpoint in relation to tour operators.\n",
      "so our problem, immediately, with someone like Thomas Cook, was, we don't really want our customers going onto your main website, putting all of their data into you website, just to meet the obligations; because in filling in that e-form on your website, actually they are getting one step closer to becoming direct customers of you, as opposed to our customer … It's the retail travel agent's paranoia but it's a valid paranoia.\n",
      "As one informant explains, Historically, you go into travel agents and you would buy a ticket, the tickets would turn up in the post two weeks before you travel.\n",
      "You would never speak to a travel agent, never speak to your tour operator and never speak to your airline until you get to the check-in desk.\n",
      "For example, one organization is working on a ‘known traveller’ approach, where certain benefits are extended to customers who are prepared to share particular personal data.\n",
      "Thus we are seeing a resurfacing of the commercial interests of carriers and travel operators in how they are implementing their e-Borders response.\n",
      "Due to their proximity to the end user, carriers have been enlisted to develop, implement and finance traveller monitoring systems, effectively delegating and internalizing some of the costs of providing effective ‘national security’.\n",
      "We argue that the carriers, and to some extent the other travel organizations, have engaged in response to the e-Borders initiative in a process we describe as recognizing, rationalizing and refashioning.\n",
      "6.3 Refashioning We find that carriers and other travel organizations respond to the challenges of e-Borders by refashioning their ways of working.\n",
      "Although carriers initially tried to shun APIS costs by passing them on to travellers, the mood quickly changed amidst angsts about customer retention, to easing the burden of compliance for customers.\n",
      "The second motivator is the desire to explore whether e-Borders can generate commercial opportunity for carriers and travel organizations.\n",
      "Our findings have a number of implications for travel firms.\n",
      "Firstly, while the immediate pressure to achieve regulatory compliance may make it beneficial to work in partnership with other carriers and travel organizations, these benefits are likely to be short term.\n",
      "While this study did not directly examine the views of consumers, future research could examine the changing behaviour of travellers in relation to the shifting regulatory environment, considering whether the way travel products are bought or their relationships with travel firms have been affected.\n",
      "Finally, our research has focused on the implementation of a particular regulatory change affecting the UK and those travelling or supplying travel services to and from it.\n",
      "Although we make no claims about the generalizability of our findings to other contexts, tourism is a global phenomenon and we believe that travel firms in other situations where regulatory disruption is taking place, may respond in similar ways.\n",
      "Given the demise of other government sponsored databases, such as the National Identity Register, which was similarly at odds with European human rights principles, an eerie quiet has descended around the issue as if to stifle public discussion while the travel industry ‘just gets on with it’.\n",
