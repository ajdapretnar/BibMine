The web server provides a local cache of bibliographic data.

The server is composed of:
    - a web API
    - a background process

The web API provides these endpoints:
    articles/       GET     READ    get all articles
    articles/:id/   GET     READ    get a single article
    articles/       POST    CREATE  add an article
    articles/:id/   PUT     UPDATE  update an article
    articles/:id/   DELETE  DELETE  delete an article

    articles_full/       GET     READ    get all articles
    articles_full/:id/   GET     READ    get a single article
    articles_full/       POST    CREATE  add an article
    articles_full/:id/   PUT     UPDATE  update an article
    articles_full/:id/   DELETE  DELETE  delete an article

    queries/        GET     READ    get all queries
    queries/:id/    GET     READ    get a single query
    queries/        POST    CREATE  add a query
    queries/:id/    PUT     UPDATE  update a query
    queries/:id/    DELETE  DELETE  delete a query

The `article` includes information on an article (id, title, authors, abstract, journal, doi, ...).
The `query` includes a query text and the associated article ids.

The background process:
    - scans the queries table, runs new queries and stores the associated article ids
    - scans the articles table, retrives and stores new article ids
