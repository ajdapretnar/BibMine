Analysis pipelines for Tourism 4.0 project.

## Data retrieval

Data can be retrieved with scripts in the _Data retrieval_ folder. You can retrieve full articles from ScienceDirect using the _Elsevier-data-retrieval.ipynb_ script and abstracts from Scopus with the _Scopus-retrieval.ipynb_ script. Scripts are designed so that they save intermediate data to the corresponding folder.

## Create corpus

As the data is saved at intermediate breakpoints, you will have to merge it back into a single data file. You can do this by running _concatenate.ipynb_ script.

## Preprocess data
